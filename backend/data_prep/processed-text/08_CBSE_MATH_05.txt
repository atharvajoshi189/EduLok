5.1  Introduction
You know that the area of a square = side × side (where ‘side’  means ‘the length of
a side’). Study the following table.
Side of a square (in cm)
Area of the square (in cm2)

1 × 1 = 1 = 12

2 × 2 = 4 = 22

3 × 3 = 9 = 32
5
5 × 5 = 25 = 52
8
8 × 8 = 64 = 82
a
a × a = a2
What is special about the numbers 4, 9, 25, 64 and other such numbers?
Since, 4 can be expressed as 2 × 2 = 22, 9 can be expressed as 3 × 3 = 32, all such
numbers can be expressed as the product of the number with itself.
Such numbers like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... are known as square numbers.
In general, if a natural number m can be expressed as n2, where n is also a natural
number, then m is a square number. Is 32 a square number?
We know that 52 = 25 and 62 = 36. If 32 is a square number, it must be the square of
a natural number  between 5 and 6. But there is no natural number between 5 and 6.
Therefore 32 is not a square number.
Consider the following numbers and their squares.

If we combine two consecutive triangular numbers, we get a square number, like
1 + 3 = 4
3 + 6 = 9
6 + 10 = 16
          = 22

= 42
2. Numbers between square numbers
Let us now see if we can find some interesting pattern between two consecutive
square numbers.
1 (= 12)
2, 3, 4 (= 22)
5, 6, 7, 8, 9 (= 32)
10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 (= 42)
17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 (= 52)
Between 12(=1) and 22(= 4) there are two (i.e., 2 × 1) non square numbers 2, 3.
Between 22(= 4) and 32(= 9) there are four (i.e., 2 × 2) non square numbers 5, 6, 7, 8.
Now,
32 = 9,       42 = 16
Therefore,
42 – 32 = 16 – 9 = 7
Between 9(=32) and 16(= 42) the numbers are 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 that is, six
non-square numbers which is 1 less than the difference of two squares.
We have
42 = 16     and     52 = 25
Therefore,
52 – 42 = 9
Between 16(= 42) and 25(= 52) the numbers are 17, 18, ... , 24 that is, eight non square
numbers which is 1 less than the difference of two squares.
Consider 72 and 62. Can you say how many numbers are there between 62 and 72?
If we think of any natural number n and (n + 1), then,
(n + 1)2 – n2 = (n2 + 2n + 1) – n2 = 2n + 1.
We find that between n2 and (n + 1)2 there are 2n numbers which is 1 less than the
difference of two squares.
Thus, in general we can say that there are 2n non perfect square numbers between
the squares of the numbers n and (n + 1). Check for n = 5, n = 6 etc., and verify.
Two non square numbers
between the two square
numbers 1 (=12) and 4(=22).
4 non square numbers
between the two square
numbers 4(=22) and 9(32).
8 non square
numbers between
the two square
numbers 16(= 42)
and 25(=52).
6 non square numbers between
the two square numbers 9(=32)
and 16(= 42).

2. How many non square numbers lie between the following pairs of numbers
(i) 1002 and 1012
(ii) 902 and 912
(iii) 10002 and 10012
3. Adding odd numbers
Consider the following
1  [one odd number]
= 1 = 12
1 + 3  [sum of first two odd numbers]
= 4 = 22
1 + 3 + 5  [sum of first three odd numbers]
= 9 = 32
1 + 3 + 5 + 7  [... ]
= 16 = 42
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9  [... ]
= 25 = 52
1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 + 11  [... ]
= 36 = 62
So we can say that the sum of first n odd natural numbers is n2.
Looking at it in a different way, we can say: ‘If the number is a square number, it has
to be the sum of successive odd numbers starting from 1.
Consider those numbers which are not perfect squares, say 2, 3, 5, 6, ... . Can you
express these numbers as a sum of successive odd natural numbers beginning from 1?
You will find that these numbers cannot be expressed in this form.
Consider the number 25. Successively subtract 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, ... from it
(i) 25 – 1 = 24
(ii) 24 – 3 = 21
(iii) 21 – 5 = 16
(iv) 16 – 7 = 9
(v) 9 – 9 = 0
This means, 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9. Also, 25 is a perfect square.
Now consider another number 38, and again do as above.
(i) 38 – 1 = 37
(ii) 37 – 3 = 34
(iii) 34 – 5 = 29
(iv) 29 – 7 = 22
(v) 22 – 9 = 13
(vi) 13 – 11 = 2
(vii) 2 – 13 = – 11
This shows that we are not able to express 38 as the
sum of consecutive odd numbers starting with 1. Also, 38 is
not a perfect square.
So we can also say that if a natural number cannot be
expressed as a sum of successive odd natural numbers
starting with 1, then it is not a perfect square.
We can use this result to find whether a number is a perfect
square or not.
4. A sum of consecutive natural numbers

32 = 9 = 4 + 5
52 = 25 = 12 + 13

Vow! we can express the
square of any odd number as
the sum of two consecutive
positive integers.
92 = 81 = 40 + 41
112 = 121 = 60 + 61
152 = 225 = 112 + 113

(iii) 112
(iv) 192
2. Do you think the reverse is also true, i.e., is the sum of any two consecutive positive
integers is perfect square of a number? Give example to support your answer.
5. Product of two consecutive even or odd natural numbers
11 × 13 = 143 = 122 – 1
Also
11 × 13 = (12 – 1) × (12 + 1)
Therefore,
11 × 13 = (12 – 1) × (12 + 1) = 122 – 1
Similarly,
13 × 15 = (14 – 1) × (14 + 1) = 142 – 1
29 × 31 = (30 – 1) × (30 + 1) = 302 – 1
44 × 46 = (45 – 1) × (45 + 1) = 452 – 1

5.4  Finding the Square of a Number
Squares of small numbers like 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... etc. are easy to find. But can we find the
square of 23 so quickly?
The answer is not so easy and we may need to multiply 23 by 23.
There is a way to find this without having to multiply 23 × 23.
We know
23 = 20 + 3
Therefore
232 = (20 + 3)2 = 20(20 + 3) + 3(20 + 3)
= 202 + 20 × 3 + 3 × 20 + 32
= 400 + 60 + 60 + 9 = 529

(ii) 42
Solution: (i)
392 = (30 + 9)2 = 30(30 + 9) + 9(30 + 9)
= 302 + 30 × 9 + 9 × 30 + 92
= 900 + 270 + 270 + 81 = 1521
                    (ii)
422 = (40 + 2)2 = 40(40 + 2) + 2(40 + 2)

Consider the following

The collection of numbers 3, 4 and 5 is known as Pythagorean triplet. 6, 8, 10 is
also a Pythagorean triplet, since
62 + 82 = 36 + 64 = 100 = 102
Again, observe that
52 + 122 = 25 + 144 = 169 = 132. The numbers 5, 12, 13 form another such triplet.
Consider a number with unit digit 5, i.e., a5
(a5)2 = (10a + 5)2

Can you find more such triplets?
For any natural number m > 1, we have (2m)2 + (m2 – 1)2 = (m2 + 1)2. So, 2m,
m2 – 1 and m2 + 1 forms a Pythagorean triplet.
Try to find some more Pythagorean triplets using this form.
Example 2: Write a Pythagorean triplet whose smallest member is 8.
Solution: We can get Pythagorean triplets by using general form 2m, m2 – 1, m2 + 1.
Let us first take
m2 – 1 = 8
So,
m2 = 8 + 1 = 9
which gives
m = 3
Therefore,
2m = 6   and    m2 + 1 = 10
The triplet is thus 6, 8, 10.  But 8 is not the smallest member of this.
So, let us try
2m = 8
then
m = 4
We get
m2 – 1 = 16 – 1 = 15
and
m2 + 1 = 16 + 1 = 17
The triplet is 8, 15, 17 with 8 as the smallest member.
Example 3: Find a Pythagorean triplet in which one member is 12.
Solution: If we take
m2 – 1 = 12
Then,
m2 = 12 + 1 = 13
Then the value of m will not be an integer.
So, we try to take m2 + 1 = 12. Again m2 = 11 will not give an integer value for m.
So, let us take
2m = 12
then
m = 6
Thus,
m2 – 1 = 36 – 1 = 35    and
m2 + 1 = 36 + 1 = 37
Therefore, the required triplet is 12, 35, 37.
Note: All Pythagorean triplets may not be obtained using this form. For example another
triplet 5, 12, 13 also has 12 as a member.

We know that the area of a square = side2
If we assume the length of the side to be ‘a’, then 144 = a2
To find the length of side it is necessary to find a number whose square is 144.
(b) What is the length of a diagonal of a square of side 8 cm (Fig 5.1)?
Can we use Pythagoras theorem to solve this ?
   We have,
AB2 + BC2 = AC2
i.e.,
82 + 82 = AC2
or
64 + 64 = AC2
or
128 = AC2
Again to get AC we need to think of a number whose square is 128.
(c) In a right triangle the length of the hypotenuse and a side are
respectively 5 cm and 3 cm (Fig 5.2).
Can you find the third side?
Let x cm be the length of the third side.
Using Pythagoras theorem
52 = x2 + 32
25 – 9 =  x2
16 = x 2
Again, to find x we need a number whose square is 16.
In all the above cases, we need to find a number whose square is known. Finding the
number with the known square is known as finding the square root.
5.5.1  Finding square roots
The inverse (opposite) operation of addition is subtraction and the inverse operation
of multiplication is division. Similarly, finding the square root is the inverse operation
of squaring.
We have,
12 = 1, therefore square root of 1 is 1
22 = 4, therefore square root of 4 is 2
32 = 9, therefore square root of 9 is 3

Since
92 = 81,
and
(–9)2 = 81
We say that square
roots of 81 are 9 and –9.
(–1)2 = 1. Is –1, a square root of 1?
(–2)2 =  4. Is –2, a square root of 4?
(–9)2 = 81. Is –9 a square root of 81?
From the above, you may say that there are two integral square roots of a perfect square
number. In this chapter, we shall take up only positive square root of a natural number.
Positive square root of a number is denoted by the symbol 
.
For example: 4 = 2 (not –2);      9 = 3 (not –3) etc.

5.5.2  Finding square root through repeated subtraction
Do you remember that the sum of the first n odd natural numbers is n2? That is, every square
number can be expressed as a sum of successive odd natural numbers starting from 1.
Consider 81. Then,
(i) 81 – 1 = 80
(ii) 80 – 3 = 77
(iii)
77 – 5 = 72
(iv) 72 – 7 = 65
(v) 65 – 9 = 56
(vi) 56 – 11 = 45
(vii)
45 – 13 = 32
(viii) 32 – 15 = 17
(ix) 17 – 17 = 0
From 81 we have subtracted successive odd
numbers starting from 1 and obtained 0 at 9th step.
Therefore 81 = 9.
Can you find the square root of 729 using this method?
Yes, but it will be time consuming. Let us try to find it in
a simpler way.
5.5.3  Finding square root through prime factorisation
Consider the prime factorisation of the following numbers and their squares.
Prime factorisation of a Number
Prime factorisation of its Square
6 = 2 × 3
36 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3
8 =  2 × 2 × 2
64 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
12 = 2 × 2 × 3
144 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3
15 = 3 × 5
225 = 3 × 3 × 5 × 5
How many times does 2 occur in the prime factorisation of 6? Once. How many times
does 2 occur in the prime factorisation of 36? Twice. Similarly, observe the occurrence of
3 in 6 and 36 of 2 in 8 and 64 etc.
You will find that each prime factor in the prime factorisation of the
square of a number, occurs twice the number of times it occurs in the
prime factorisation of the number itself. Let us use this to find the square
root of a given square number, say 324.
We know that the prime factorisation of 324 is
324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3

By pairing the prime factors, we get
324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3  = 22 × 32 × 32 = (2 × 3 × 3)2
So,
324 = 2 × 3 × 3 = 18
Similarly can you find the square root of 256? Prime factorisation of 256 is
256 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
By pairing the prime factors we get,
256 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = (2 × 2 × 2 × 2)2
Therefore,
256  =  2 × 2 × 2 × 2 = 16
Is 48 a perfect square?
We know
48 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3
Since all the factors are not in pairs so 48 is not a perfect square.
Suppose we want to find the smallest multiple of 48 that is a perfect square, how
should we proceed? Making pairs of the prime factors of 48 we see that 3 is the only
factor that does not have a pair. So we need to multiply by 3 to complete the pair.
Hence
48 × 3 = 144 is a perfect square.
Can you tell by which number should we divide 48 to get a perfect square?
The factor 3 is not in pair, so if we divide 48 by 3 we get 48 ÷ 3 = 16 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
and this number 16 is a perfect square too.
Example 4: Find the square root of 6400.
Solution: Write 6400 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 × 5
Therefore
6400  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 = 80
Example 5: Is 90 a perfect square?
Solution: We have 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5
The prime factors 2 and 5 do not occur in pairs. Therefore, 90 is not a perfect square.
That 90 is not a perfect square can also be seen from the fact that  it has only one zero.
Example 6: Is 2352 a perfect square? If not, find the smallest multiple of 2352 which
is a perfect square. Find the square root of the new number.
Solution: We have 2352 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 × 7
As the prime factor 3 has no pair, 2352 is not a perfect square.
If 3 gets a pair then the number will become perfect square. So, we multiply 2352 by 3 to get,
2352 × 3 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 7 × 7
Now each prime factor is in a pair. Therefore, 2352 × 3 = 7056   is a perfect square.
Thus the required smallest multiple of 2352 is 7056 which is a perfect square.
And,
7056  = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 = 84
Example 7: Find the smallest number by which 9408 must be divided so that the
quotient is a perfect square. Find the square root of the quotient.

Solution: We have, 9408 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 × 7
If we divide 9408 by the factor 3, then
9408 ÷ 3 = 3136 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 × 7  which is a perfect square. (Why?)
Therefore, the required smallest number is 3.
And,
3136  = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 = 56.
Example 8: Find the smallest square number which is divisible by each of the numbers
6, 9 and 15.
Solution: This has to be done in two steps. First find the smallest common multiple and
then find the square number needed. The least number divisible by each one of 6, 9 and
15 is their LCM. The LCM of 6, 9 and 15 is 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 = 90.
Prime factorisation of 90 is 90 = 2 × 3 × 3 × 5.
We see that prime factors 2 and 5 are not in pairs. Therefore 90 is not a perfect
square.
In order to get a perfect square, each factor of 90 must be paired. So we need to
make pairs of 2 and 5. Therefore, 90 should be multiplied by 2 × 5, i.e., 10.
Hence, the required square number is 90 × 10 = 900.

5.5.4  Finding square root by division method
When the numbers are large, even the method of finding square root by prime factorisation
becomes lengthy and difficult. To overcome this problem we use Long Division Method.
For this we need to determine the number of digits in the square root.
See the following table:
Number
Square
10
100
which is the smallest 3-digit perfect square
31
961
which is the greatest 3-digit perfect square
32
1024
which is the smallest 4-digit perfect square
99
9801
which is the greatest 4-digit perfect square
So, what can we say about the number of digits in the square root if a perfect
square is a 3-digit or a 4-digit number? We can say that, if a perfect square is a
3-digit or a 4-digit number, then its square root will have 2-digits.
Can you tell the number of digits in the square root of a 5-digit or a 6-digit
perfect square?
The smallest 3-digit perfect square number is 100 which is the square of 10 and the
greatest 3-digit perfect square number is 961 which is the square of 31. The smallest
4-digit square number is 1024 which is the square of 32 and the greatest 4-digit number is
9801 which is the square of 99.
Can we say that if a perfect square is of n-digits, then its square root will have 2
n
digits if n is even or (
1)
2
n +
 if n is odd?
The use of the number of digits in square root of a number is useful in the following method:
• Consider the following steps to find the square root of 529.
Can you estimate the number of digits in the square root of this number?
Step 1
Place a bar over every pair of digits starting from the digit at one’s place. If the
number of digits in it is odd, then the left-most single digit too will have a bar.
Thus we have, 529 .
Step 2
Find the largest number whose square is less than or equal to the number under the
extreme left bar (22 < 5 < 32). Take this number as the divisor and the quotient
with the number under the extreme left bar as the dividend (here 5). Divide and
get the remainder (1 in this case).


Step 3
Bring down the number under the next bar (i.e., 29 in this case) to the right of
the remainder. So the new dividend is 129.
Step 4
Double the quotient and enter it with a blank on its right.
Step 5
Guess a largest possible digit to fill the blank which will also become the new
digit in the quotient, such that when the new divisor is multiplied to the new
quotient the product is less than or equal to the dividend.
In this case 42 × 2 = 84.
As 43 × 3 = 129 so we choose the new digit as 3. Get the remainder.
Step 6
Since the remainder is 0 and no digits are left in the given number, therefore,
529  = 23.
• Now consider 4096
Step 1
Place a bar over every pair of digits starting from the one’s digit. ( 40 96).
Step 2
Find the largest number whose square is less than or equal to the number under
the left-most bar (62 < 40 < 72). Take this number as the divisor and the number
under the left-most bar as the dividend. Divide and get the remainder i.e., 4 in
this case.
Step 3
Bring down the number under the next bar  (i.e., 96) to the right of the remainder.
The new dividend is 496.
Step 4
Double the quotient and enter it with a blank on its right.
Step 5
Guess a largest possible digit to fill the blank which also becomes the new digit in the
quotient such that when the new digit is multiplied to the new quotient the product is
less than or equal to the dividend. In this case we see that 124 × 4 = 496.
So the new digit in the quotient is 4. Get the remainder.
Step 6
Since the remainder is 0 and no bar left, therefore, 4096  = 64.
Estimating the number
We use bars to find the number of digits in the square root of a perfect square number.
529  = 23          and         
4096 = 64
In both the numbers 529 and 4096 there are two bars and the number of digits in their
square root is 2. Can you tell the number of digits in the square root of 14400?
By placing bars we get 14400. Since there are 3 bars, the square root will be of 3 digit.

Example 10: Find the least number that must be subtracted from 5607 so as to get
a perfect square. Also find the square root of the perfect square.
Solution: Let us try to find 
5607  by long division method. We get the
remainder 131. It shows that 742 is less than 5607 by 131.
This means if we subtract the remainder from the number, we get a perfect square.
Therefore, the required perfect square is 5607 – 131 = 5476.  And, 5476  =  74.
Example 11: Find the greatest 4-digit number which is a perfect square.
Solution: Greatest number of 4-digits = 9999. We find 9999  by long division
method. The remainder is 198. This shows 992 is less than 9999 by 198.
This means if we subtract the remainder from the number, we get a perfect square.
Therefore, the required perfect square is 9999 – 198 = 9801.
And,  9801 = 99
Example 12: Find the least number that must be added to 1300 so as to get a
perfect square. Also find the square root of the perfect square.
Solution: We find 1300  by long division method. The remainder is 4.
This shows that 362 < 1300.
Next perfect square number is 372 = 1369.
Hence, the number to be added is 372 – 1300 = 1369 – 1300 = 69.

(i.e., 64) on every pair of digits beginning with the first decimal place. Proceed
as usual. We get 17.64.
Step 2
Now proceed in a similar manner. The left most bar is on 17 and 42 < 17 < 52.
Take this number as the divisor and the number under the left-most bar as the
dividend, i.e., 17. Divide and get the remainder.
Step 3
The remainder is 1. Write the number under the next bar (i.e., 64) to the right of
this remainder, to get 164.
Step 4
Double the divisor and enter it with a blank on its right.
Since 64 is the decimal part so put a decimal point in the
quotient.
Step 5
We know 82 × 2 = 164, therefore, the new digit is 2.
Divide and get the remainder.
Step 6
Since the remainder is 0 and no bar left, therefore 17.64

Solution:
Which way to move
Consider a number 176.341. Put bars on both integral part and decimal part. In what way
is putting bars on decimal part different from integral part? Notice for 176 we start from
the unit’s place close to the decimal and move towards left. The first bar is over 76 and the
second bar over 1. For .341, we start from the decimal and move towards right. First bar
is over 34 and for the second bar we put 0 after 1 and make .3410 .
Example 14: Area of a square plot is 2304 m2. Find the side of the square plot.
Solution: Area of square plot = 2304 m2
Therefore,
side of the square plot =
2304 m
We find that,
2304  = 48
Thus, the side of the square plot is 48 m.

Solution: Let the number of rows be x
So, the number of columns = x
