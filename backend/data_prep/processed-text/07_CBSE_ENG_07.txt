Before you read
Who are the oldest people you know? What are the
oldest things you have (i) in your house, (ii) in your city,
town or village? How old are they?
Have you ever wished that you were older? Have
you wished that you could grow up in a hurry?
Mr Willy Wonka begins by inventing Wonka-
Vite, which makes people younger. But Wonka-
Vite is too strong.  So some people disappear,
because their age becomes Minus! One person
actually becomes minus eighty-seven, which
means he’s got to wait eighty-seven years
before he can come back.
Mr Willy Wonka must invent a new thing...
I
r Wonka said, “So once again I rolled
up my sleeves and set to work. Once
again I squeezed  my brain, searching for the new
recipe... I had to create age... to make people old...
old, older, oldest... ‘Ha-ha!’ I cried, for now the
ideas were beginning to come. ‘What is the oldest
living thing in the world?  What lives longer than
anything else?’”

THE INVENTION OF VITA-WONK/101
“A tree,” Charlie said.
“Right you are, Charlie!  But what kind of a
tree?  Not the Douglas fir.  Not the oak.  Not the
cedar. No, no, my boy.  It is a tree called the
Bristlecone pine that grows upon the slopes of
Wheeler Peak in Nevada, U.S.A.  You can find
Bristlecone Pines on Wheeler Peak today that
are over 4000 years old!  This is fact, Charlie.  Ask
any dendrochronologist you like (and look that
word up in the dictionary when you  get home,
will you please?).  So that started me off.  I
jumped into the Great Glass Elevator and
rushed all over the world collecting special items
from the oldest living things...

“All over the world, Charlie,” Mr Wonka went on
“I tracked down very old and ancient animals and
took an important little bit of something from each
one of them — a hair or an eyebrow or sometimes
it was no more than an ounce or two of the jam
scraped from between its toes while it was
sleeping. I tracked down THE WHISTLE-PIG, THE
BOBOLINK, THE SKROCK, THE POLLYFROG, THE
GIANT CURLICUE, THE STINGING SLUG AND THE
VENOMOUS SQUERKLE who can spit poison right
into your eye from fifty yards away.  But there’s

my Inventing Room, I produced one tiny cupful of
oily black liquid and gave four drops of it to a
brave twenty-year-old Oompa-Loompa volunteer
to see what happened.”
“What did happen?” Charlie asked.
“It was fantastic!” cried Mr Wonka. “The
moment he swallowed it, he began wrinkling and
shrivelling up all over and his hair started
dropping off and his teeth started falling out and,
before I knew it, he had suddenly become an old
fellow of seventy-five!  And thus, my dear Charlie,
was Vita-Wonk invented!”

Writing
1.
(i)
Make a list of the trees Mr Wonka mentions. Where
do these trees grow? Try to find out from an
encyclopaedia. Write a short paragraph about two or
three of these trees.
(ii)
Name some large trees commonly found in your area.
Find out something about them (How old are they?
Who planted them? Do birds eat their fruit?), and
write two or three sentences about each one of them.
2. Find out something interesting about age, or growing old,
and write a paragraph about it. Following are a few topics,
suggested as examples.
• The age profile of a country’s population — does it have
more young people than old people, or vice versa? What
are the consequences of this?
• How can we tell how old a tree, a horse, or a rock is?
• What is the ‘life expectancy’ of various living things,
and various populations (how long can they reasonably
expect to live)?
Delivery Delayed
When the postman arrived at the Roy
household to deliver the mail, he was surprised
to find a new vicious dog. The dog was fastened
to a tree by a leash just long enough to reach
the front door. The dog growled and bared its
teeth. But the postman managed to outwit the
dog and reach the front door safely. How?

Dad and the Cat
and the Tree
Have you ever seen a cat climbing a tree?  Sometimes
a cat may climb too high and get stuck in the tree.
The poor thing can’t come down without help. How
would you help it?  Surely, not like Dad in the poem.
Is Dad a good climber?  What were his plans?  Read
the poem to find out.
This morning a cat got
Stuck in our tree.
Dad said, “Right, just
Leave it to me.”
The tree was wobbly,
The tree was tall.
Mum said, “For goodness’
Sake don’t fall!”
“Fall?” scoffed Dad,
“A climber like me?
Child’s play, this is!
You wait and see.”
He got out the ladder
From the garden shed.
It slipped. He landed
In the flower bed.

THE INVENTION OF VITA-WONK/109
“Never mind,” said Dad,
Brushing the dirt
Off his hair and his face
And his trousers and his shirt,
“We’ll try Plan B. Stand
Out of the way!”
Mum said, “Don’t fall
Again, O.K.?”
“Fall again?” said Dad.
“Funny joke!”
Then he swung himself up
On a branch. It broke.
Dad landed wallop
Back on the deck.
Mum said, “Stop it,
You’ll break your neck!”
“Rubbish!” said Dad.
“Now we’ll try Plan C.
Easy as winking
To a climber like me!”

Then he climbed up high
On the garden  wall.
Guess what?
He didn’t fall!
He gave a great leap
And he landed flat
In the crook of the tree-trunk —
Right on the cat!
The cat gave a yell
And sprang to the ground,
Pleased as Punch to be
Safe and sound.
So it’s smiling and smirking,
Smug as can be,
But poor old Dad’s
Still
Stuck
Up
The
Tree!

Garden Snake
Have you ever seen a snake fighting a mongoose, or
getting into a hole, or swimming in the river?  Everyone,
almost everyone, believes that snakes are dangerous.
Some are, most are not.  Read this poem on a harmless
garden snake.
I saw a snake and ran away...
Some snakes are dangerous, they say;
But mother says that kind is good,
And eats up insects for his food.
So when he wiggles in the grass
I’ll stand aside and watch him pass,
And tell myself, “There’s no mistake,
It’s just a harmless garden snake!”
MURIEL L. SONNE

Do you know...
Answer
According to some botanists, plants are able
to sense the vibrations of music through their
stomata. How this occurs is not yet known.
Yields of some crops are reported to have
increased substantially when the plants
were exposed to music. Many plant lovers,
including Prince Charles of Britain, believe
that talking to plants makes them grow better.
