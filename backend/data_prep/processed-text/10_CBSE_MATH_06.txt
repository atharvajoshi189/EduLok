6.1 Introduction
You are familiar with triangles and many of their properties from your earlier classes.
In Class IX, you have studied congruence of triangles in detail. Recall that two figures
are said to be congruent, if they have the same shape and the same size. In this
chapter, we shall study about those figures which have the same shape but not necessarily
the same size. Two figures having the same shape (and not necessarily the same size)
are called similar figures. In particular, we shall discuss the similarity of triangles and
apply this knowledge in giving a simple proof of Pythagoras Theorem learnt earlier.
Can you guess how heights of mountains (say Mount Everest) or distances of
some long distant objects (say moon) have been found out? Do you think these have

been measured directly with the help of a measuring tape? In fact, all these heights
and distances have been found out using the idea of indirect measurements, which is
based on the principle of similarity of figures (see Example 7, Q.15 of Exercise 6.3
and also Chapters 8 and 9 of this book).
6.2 Similar Figures
In Class IX, you have seen that all circles with the same radii are congruent, all
squares with the same side lengths are congruent and all equilateral triangles with the
same side lengths are congruent.
Now consider any two (or more)
circles [see Fig. 6.1 (i)]. Are they
congruent? Since all of them do not
have the same radius, they are not
congruent to each other. Note that
some are congruent and some are not,
but all of them have the same shape.
So they all are, what we call, similar.
Two similar figures have the same
shape but not necessarily the same
size. Therefore, all circles are similar.
What about two (or more) squares or
two (or more) equilateral triangles
[see Fig. 6.1 (ii) and (iii)]? As observed
in the case of circles, here also all
squares are similar and all equilateral
triangles are similar.
From the above, we can say
that all congruent figures are
similar but the similar figures need
not be congruent.
Can a circle and a square be
similar? Can a triangle and a square
be similar? These questions can be
answered by just looking at the
figures (see Fig. 6.1). Evidently
these figures are not similar. (Why?)

What can you say about the two quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS
(see Fig 6.2)?Are they similar? These  figures appear to be similar but we cannot be
certain about it.Therefore, we must have some definition of similarity of figures and
based on this definition some rules to decide whether the two given figures are similar
or not. For this, let us look at the photographs given in Fig. 6.3:
Fig. 6.3
You will at once say that they are the photographs of the same monument
(Taj Mahal) but are in different sizes. Would you say that the three photographs  are
similar? Yes,they are.
What can you say about the two photographs of the same size of the same
person one at the age of 10 years and the other at the age of 40 years? Are these
photographs similar? These photographs are of the same size but certainly they are
not of the same shape. So, they are not similar.
What does the photographer do when she prints photographs of different sizes
from the same negative? You must  have heard about the stamp size, passport size and
postcard size photographs. She generally takes a photograph on a small size film, say
of 35mm size and then enlarges it into a bigger size, say 45mm (or 55mm). Thus, if we
consider any line segment in the smaller photograph (figure), its corresponding line
segment in the bigger photograph (figure) will be 45

 of that of the line segment.
This really means that every line segment of the smaller photograph is enlarged
(increased) in the ratio 35:45 (or 35:55).  It can also be said that every line segment
of the bigger photograph is reduced (decreased) in the ratio 45:35 (or 55:35). Further,
if you consider inclinations (or angles) between any pair of corresponding line segments
in the two photographs of different sizes, you shall see that these inclinations(or angles)
are always equal. This is the essence of the similarity of two figures and in particular
of two polygons. We say that:
Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their
corresponding angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the
same ratio (or proportion).

MATHEMATICS
Note that the same ratio of the corresponding sides is referred to as the scale
factor (or the Representative Fraction) for the polygons. You must have heard that
world maps (i.e., global maps) and blue prints for the construction of a building are
prepared using a suitable scale factor and observing certain conventions.
In order to understand similarity of figures more clearly, let us perform the following
activity:
Activity 1 :  Place a lighted bulb at a
point O on the ceiling  and directly below
it a table in your classroom. Let us cut a
polygon, say a quadrilateral ABCD, from
a plane cardboard and place this
cardboard parallel to the ground between
the lighted bulb  and the table. Then a
shadow of ABCD is cast on the table.
Mark the outline of this shadow as
ABCD (see Fig.6.4).
Note that the quadrilateral ABCD  is
an enlargement (or magnification) of  the
quadrilateral ABCD. This is because of
the property of light that light propogates
in a straight line. You may also note that
A lies on ray OA, B lies on ray OB, C
lies on  OC and D lies on OD.  Thus, quadrilaterals ABCD  and ABCD are of the
same shape but of different sizes.
So, quadrilateral  ABCD  is similiar to quadrilateral ABCD. We can also say
that quadrilateral ABCD is similar to the quadrilateral ABCD.
Here, you can also note that vertex A corresponds to vertex A, vertex B
corresponds to vertex B, vertex C corresponds to vertex C and vertex  D corresponds
to vertex D. Symbolically, these correspondences are represented as A A, B B,
C C and D D. By actually measuring the angles and the sides of the two
quadrilaterals, you may verify that
(i)  A =  A,  B =  B,  C =  C,  D =  D and
(ii)  AB

This again emphasises that two polygons of the same number of sides are
similar, if (i) all the corresponding angles are equal and (ii) all the corresponding
sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).

From the above, you can easily say that quadrilaterals ABCD and PQRS of
Fig. 6.5 are similar.
Fig. 6.5
Remark : You can verify that if one polygon is similar to another polygon and this
second polygon is similar to a third polygon, then the first polygon is similar to the third
polygon.
You may note that in the two quadrilaterals (a square and a rectangle) of
Fig. 6.6, corresponding angles are equal, but their corresponding sides are not in the
same ratio.
Fig. 6.6
So, the two quadrilaterals are not similar. Similarly, you may note that in the two
quadrilaterals (a square and a rhombus) of Fig. 6.7, corresponding sides are in the
same ratio, but their corresponding angles are not equal. Again, the two polygons
(quadrilaterals) are not similar.

6.3 Similarity of Triangles
What can you say about the similarity of two triangles?
You may recall that triangle is also a polygon. So, we can state the same conditions
for the similarity of two triangles. That is:
Two triangles are similiar, if
(i) their corresponding angles are equal and
(ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).
Note that if corresponding angles of two
triangles are equal, then they are known as
equiangular triangles. A famous Greek
mathematician Thales gave an important truth relating
to two equiangular triangles which is as follows:
The ratio of any two corresponding sides in
two equiangular triangles is always the same.
It is believed that he had used a result called
the Basic Proportionality Theorem (now known as
the Thales Theorem) for the same.
To understand the Basic Proportionality
Theorem, let us perform the following activity:
Activity 2 : Draw any angle XAY and on its one
arm AX, mark points (say five points) P, Q, D, R and
B such that AP = PQ = QD = DR = RB.
Now, through B, draw any line intersecting arm
AY at C (see Fig. 6.9).
Also, through the point D, draw a line parallel
to BC to intersect AC at E. Do you observe from
your constructions that AD

theorem (known as the Basic Proportionality Theorem):

Theorem 6.1 : If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the
other two sides in distinct points, the other two sides are divided in the same

Similarly,

Is the converse of this theorem also true (For the meaning of converse, see
Appendix 1)? To examine this, let us perform the following activity:
Activity 3 :  Draw an angle XAY on your
notebook and on ray AX, mark points B1, B2,
B3, B4 and B such that AB1 = B1B2 = B2B3 =
B3B4 = B4B.
Similarly, on ray AY, mark points
C1, C2, C3, C4 and C such that AC1 = C1C2 =
C2C3 = C3C4 = C4C. Then join B1C1 and BC

From (1), (2), (3) and (4), it can be observed that if a line divides two sides of a
triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the third side.
You can repeat this activity by drawing any angle XAY of different measure and
taking any  number of equal parts on arms AX and AY . Each time, you will arrive at
the same result. Thus, we obtain the following theorem, which is the converse of

6.4 Criteria for Similarity of Triangles

angles are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).

MATHEMATICS
Here, you can see that A corresponds to D, B corresponds to E and C
corresponds to F. Symbolically, we write the similarity of these two triangles as
‘ ABC ~  DEF’ and read it as ‘triangle ABC is similar to triangle DEF’. The
symbol ‘~’ stands for ‘is similar to’. Recall that you have used the symbol ‘’ for
‘is congruent to’ in Class IX.
It must be noted that as done in the case of congruency of two triangles, the
similarity of two triangles should also be expressed symbolically, using correct
correspondence of their vertices. For example, for the triangles ABC and DEF of
Fig. 6.22, we cannot write  ABC ~  EDF or  ABC ~  FED. However, we
can write  BAC ~  EDF.
Now a natural question arises : For checking the similarity of two triangles, say
ABC and DEF, should we always look for all the equality relations of their corresponding
angles ( A =  D,  B =  E,  C =  F) and all the equality relations of the ratios
of their corresponding sides

only three pairs of corresponding parts (or elements) of the two triangles. Here also,
let us make an attempt to arrive at certain criteria for similarity of two triangles involving
relationship between less number of pairs of corresponding parts of the two triangles,
instead of all the six pairs of corresponding parts. For this, let us perform the following
activity:
Activity 4 : Draw two line segments BC and EF of two different lengths, say 3 cm
and 5 cm respectively. Then, at the points B and C respectively, construct angles PBC
and QCB of some measures, say, 60° and 40°. Also, at the points E and F, construct
angles REF and SFE of 60° and 40° respectively (see Fig. 6.23).

Let rays BP and CQ intersect each other at A and rays ER and FS intersect each

triangles are equal. What can you say about their corresponding sides ? Note that

constructing several pairs of triangles having their corresponding angles equal. Every
time, you will find that their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion).
This activity leads us to the following criterion for similarity of two triangles.
Theorem 6.3 : If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their
corresponding sides are in the same ratio (or proportion) and hence the two
triangles are similar.
This criterion is referred to as the AAA
(Angle–Angle–Angle) criterion of
similarity of two triangles.
This theorem can be proved by taking two
triangles ABC and DEF such that
 A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F
(see Fig. 6.24)
Cut DP = AB and DQ = AC and join PQ.

Remark : If two angles of a triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another
triangle, then by the angle sum property of a triangle their third angles will also be
equal. Therefore, AAA similarity criterion can also be stated as follows:

If two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to two angles of another
triangle, then the two triangles are similar.
This may be referred to as the AA similarity criterion for two triangles.
You have seen above that if the three angles of one triangle are respectively
equal to the three angles of another triangle, then their corresponding sides are
proportional (i.e., in the same ratio). What about the converse of this statement? Is the
converse true? In other words, if the sides of a triangle are respectively proportional to
the sides of another triangle, is it true that their corresponding angles are equal? Let us
examine it through an activity :
Activity 5 : Draw two triangles ABC and DEF such that AB = 3 cm, BC = 6 cm,
CA = 8 cm, DE = 4.5 cm, EF = 9 cm and FD = 12 cm (see Fig. 6.25).

 A =  D,  B =  E and  C =  F, i.e., the corresponding angles of the two
triangles are equal.
You can repeat this activity by drawing several such triangles (having their sides
in the same ratio). Everytime  you shall see that their corresponding angles are equal.
It is due to the following criterion of similarity of two triangles:
Theorem 6.4 : If in two triangles, sides of one triangle are proportional to
(i.e., in the same ratio of ) the sides of the other triangle, then their corresponding
angles are equal and hence the two triangles are similiar.
This criterion is referred to as the SSS (Side–Side–Side) similarity criterion for
two triangles.

Remark : You may recall that either of the two conditions namely, (i) corresponding

two polygons to be similar. However, on the basis of Theorems 6.3 and 6.4, you can
now say that in case of similarity of the two triangles, it is not necessary to check both
the conditions as one condition implies the other.
Let us now recall the various criteria for congruency of two triangles learnt in
Class IX. You may observe that SSS similarity criterion can be compared with the SSS
congruency criterion.This suggests us to look for a similarity criterion comparable to
SAS congruency criterion of triangles. For this, let us perform an activity.

is, one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and sides including
these angles are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion). Now let us measure  B,  C,
 E and  F.
You will find that  B =  E and  C =  F. That is,  A =  D,  B =  E and

activity by drawing several pairs of such triangles with one angle of a triangle equal to
one angle of another triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional.
Everytime, you will find that the triangles are similar. It is due to the following criterion
of similarity of triangles:
Theorem 6.5 : If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of the other
triangle and the sides including these angles are proportional, then the two
triangles are similar.
This criterion is referred to as
the SAS (Side–Angle–Side)
similarity criterion for two
triangles.
As before, this theorem can
be proved by taking two triangles
ABC and DEF such that
AB
AC
DE
DF

 ( 1) and  A =  D
(see Fig. 6.28). Cut DP = AB, DQ
= AC and join PQ.

Now,
PQ || EF and  ABC  DPQ
(How ?)
So,
 A =  D,  B =  P and  C =  Q
Therefore,
 ABC ~  DEF
(Why?)
We now take some examples to illustrate the use of these criteria.
Example 4 : In Fig. 6.29, if PQ || RS, prove that  POQ ~  SOR.
Fig. 6.29
Solution :
PQ || RS
(Given)
So,
 P =  S
(Alternate angles)
and
 Q =  R
Also,
 POQ =  SOR
(Vertically opposite angles)
Therefore,
 POQ ~  SOR
(AAA similarity criterion)
Example 5 : Observe Fig. 6.30 and then find  P.

Therefore,
 C =  P
(Corresponding angles of similar triangles)
But
 C = 180° –  A –  B
(Angle sum property)
= 180° – 80° – 60° = 40°
So,
 P = 40°
Example 6 : In Fig. 6.31,
OA . OB = OC . OD.
Show that
 A =  C and  B =  D.
Solution :
OA . OB = OC . OD
(Given)
So,

OC  = OD

Also, we have
 AOD =  COB
(Vertically opposite angles) (2)
Therefore, from (1) and (2),
 AOD ~  COB     (SAS similarity criterion)
So,
 A =  C and  D =  B
(Corresponding angles of similar triangles)
Example 7 : A girl of height 90 cm is
walking  away from the base of a
lamp-post at a speed of 1.2 m/s. If the lamp
is 3.6 m above the ground, find the length
of her shadow after 4 seconds.
Solution : Let AB denote the lamp-post
and CD the girl after walking for 4 seconds
away from the lamp-post (see Fig. 6.32).
From the figure, you can see that DE is the
shadow of the girl. Let DE be x metres.

Now, BD = 1.2 m × 4 = 4.8 m.
Note that in  ABE and  CDE,
 B =  D
(Each is of 90° because lamp-post
as well as the girl are standing
vertical to the ground)
and
 E =  E
(Same angle)
So,
 ABE ~  CDE
(AA similarity criterion)
Therefore,

i.e.,
4.8 + x = 4x
i.e.,
3x = 4.8
i.e.,
x = 1.6
So, the shadow of the girl after walking for 4 seconds is 1.6 m long.
Example 8 : In Fig. 6.33, CM and RN are
respectively the medians of  ABC and

6.5 Summary
In this chapter you have studied the following points :
1. Two figures having the same shape but not necessarily the same size are called similar
figures.
2. All the congruent figures are similar but the converse is not true.
3. Two polygons of the same number of sides are similar, if (i) their corresponding angles
are equal and (ii) their corresponding sides are in the same ratio (i.e., proportion).
4. If a line is drawn parallel to one side of a triangle to intersect the other two sides in
distinct points, then the other two sides are divided in the same ratio.
5. If a line divides any two sides of a triangle in the same ratio, then the line is parallel to the
third side.
6. If in two triangles, corresponding angles are equal, then their corresponding sides are in
the same ratio and hence the two triangles are similar (AAA similarity criterion).
7. If in two triangles, two angles of one triangle are respectively equal to the two angles of
the other triangle, then the two triangles are similar (AA similarity criterion).

8. If in two triangles, corresponding sides are in the same ratio, then their corresponding
angles are equal and hence the triangles are similar (SSS similarity criterion).
9. If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle and the sides including
these angles are in the same ratio (proportional), then the triangles are similar
(SAS similarity criterion).
A NOTE TO THE READER
If in two right triangles, hypotenuse and one side of one triangle are
proportional to the hypotenuse and one side of the other triangle,
then the two triangles are similar. This may be referred to as the
RHS Similarity Criterion.
If you use this criterion in Example 2, Chapter 8, the proof will become
simpler.
