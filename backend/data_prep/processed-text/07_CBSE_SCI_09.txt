Motion and Time

I
n Class VI, you learnt about different
types of motions. You learnt that a
motion could be along a straight line,
it could be circular or periodic. Can you
recall these three types of motions?
Table 9.1 gives some common
examples of motions. Identify the type
of motion in each case.
9.1 SLOW OR FAST
We know that some vehicles move faster
than others. Even the same vehicle may
move faster or slower at different times.
Make a list of ten objects moving along
a straight path. Group the motion of
these objects as slow and fast. How did
you decide which object is moving slow
and which one is moving fast?
If vehicles are moving on a road in
the same direction, we can easily tell
which one of them is moving faster than
the other. Let us look at the motion of
vehicles moving on a road.
Activity 9.1
Look at Fig. 9.1. It shows the position
of some vehicles moving on a road in
the same direction at some instant of
time. Now look at Fig. 9.2. It shows the
position of the same vehicles after some
time. From your observation of the two
figures, answer the following questions:
Which vehicle is moving the fastest
of all? Which one of them is moving the
slowest of all?
The distance moved by objects in a
given interval of time can help us to
decide which one is faster or slower. For
example, imagine that you have gone to
see off your friend at the bus stand.
Suppose you start pedalling your bicycle
at the same time as the bus begins to

move. The distance covered by you after
5 minutes would be much smaller than
that covered by the bus. Would you say
that the bus is moving faster than the
bicycle?
We often say that the faster vehicle
has a higher speed.  In a 100-metre race
it is easy to decide whose speed
is the highest. One who takes
shortest time to cover the
distance of 100 metres has the
highest speed.
9.2 SPEED
You are probably familiar with
the word speed. In the
examples given above, a higher
speed seems to indicate that a
given distance has been
covered in a shorter time, or a
larger distance covered in a
given time.
The most convenient way to
find out which of the two or
more objects is moving faster
is to compare the distances
moved by them in a unit time.
Thus, if we know the distance
covered by two buses in one
hour, we can tell which one is
faster. We call the distance
covered by an object in a unit
time as the speed of the object.
When we say that a car is
moving with a speed of 50
kilometres per hour, it implies
that it will cover a distance of
Fig. 9.2  Position of vehicles shown in
Fig. 9.1 after some time
Fig. 9.1  Vehicles moving in the same
direction on a road
50 kilometres in one hour. However, a
car seldom moves with a constant speed
for one hour. In fact, it starts moving
slowly and then picks up speed. So,
when we say that the car has a speed of
50 kilometres per hour, we usually
consider only the total distance covered
by it in one hour. We do not bother
whether the car has been moving with

We can determine the speed of a given
object once we can measure the time
taken by it to cover a certain distance.
In Class VI you learnt how to measure
distances. But, how do we measure
time? Let us find out.
9.3 MEASUREMENT OF TIME
If you did not have a clock, how would
you decide what time of the day it is?
Have you ever wondered how our elders
could tell the approximate time of the
day by just looking at shadows?
How do we measure time interval of
a month? A year?
Our ancestors noticed that many
events in nature repeat themselves after
definite intervals of time. For example,
they found that the sun rises everyday
in the morning. The time between one
sunrise and the next was called a day.
Similarly, a month was measured from
one new moon to the next. A year was
fixed as the time taken by the earth to
complete one revolution of the sun.
Often we need to measure intervals
of time which are much shorter than a
day. Clocks or watches are perhaps the
most common time measuring devices.
Have you ever wondered how clocks and
watches measure time?
The working of clocks is rather
complex. But all of them make use of
some periodic motion. One of the most
well-known periodic motions is that of
a simple pendulum.
In everyday life we seldom find objects
moving with a constant speed over long
distances or for long durations of time.
If the speed of an object moving along
a straight line keeps changing, its
motion is said to be non-uniform. On
the other hand, an object moving along
a straight line with a constant speed
is said to be in uniform motion. In
this case, the average speed is the
same as the actual speed.

a constant speed or not during that
hour. The speed calculated here is
actually the average speed of the car. In
this book we shall use the term speed
for average speed. So, for us the speed
is the total distance covered divided
by the total time taken. Thus,
Total distance covered
Speed = 
Total time taken

A simple pendulum consists of a
small metallic ball or a piece of stone
suspended from a rigid stand by a
thread [Fig. 9.4 (a)]. The metallic ball is
called the bob of the pendulum.
Fig. 9.4 (a) shows the pendulum at
rest in its mean position. When the bob
of the pendulum is released after taking
it slightly to one side, it begins to move
to and fro [Fig. 9.4 (b)]. The to and fro
motion of a simple pendulum is an
example of a periodic or an oscillatory
motion.
The pendulum is said to have
completed one oscillation when its bob,
starting from its mean position O, moves
To set the pendulum in motion,
gently hold the bob and move it slightly
to one side. Make sure that the string
attached to the bob is taut while you
displace it. Now release the bob from its
displaced position. Remember that the
bob is not to be pushed when it is
released. Note the time on the clock
when the bob is at its mean position.
Instead of the mean position you may
note the time when the bob is at one of
its extreme positions. Measure the time
the pendulum takes to complete 20
oscillations. Record your observations

positions of the bob of an
oscillating simple pendulum

to A, to B and back to O. The
pendulum also completes one
oscillation when its bob moves
from one extreme position A to the
other extreme position B and
comes back to A. The time taken
by the pendulum to complete one
oscillation is called its time
period.
Activity 9.2
Set up a simple pendulum as
shown in Fig. 9.4 (a) with a
thread or string of length nearly
one metre. Switch off any fans
nearby. Let the bob of the
pendulum come to rest at its
mean position. Mark the mean
position of the bob on the floor
below it or on the wall behind it.
To measure the time period of
the pendulum we will need
a stopwatch. However, if a
stopwatch is not available, a table
clock or a wristwatch can be used.

cells. These clocks are called quartz
clocks. The time measured by quartz
clocks is much more accurate than that
by the clocks available earlier.
Units of time and speed
The basic unit of time is a second. Its
symbol is s. Larger units of time are
minutes (min) and hours (h). You
already know how these units are related
to one another.
What would be the basic unit of
speed?
Since the speed is distance/time, the
basic unit of speed is m/s. Of course, it
could also be expressed in other units
such as m/min or km/h.
You must remember that the
symbols of all units are written in
singular. For example, we write 50 km
and not 50 kms, or 8 cm and not 8 cms.
Boojho is wondering how many
seconds there are in a day and how
many hours in a year. Can you help
him?
in Table 9.2. The first observation shown
is just a sample. Your observations could
be different from this. Repeat this
activity a few times and record your
observations. By dividing the time taken
for 20 oscillations by 20, get the time
taken for one oscillation, or the time
period of the pendulum.
Is the time period of your pendulum
nearly the same in all cases?
Note that a slight change in the
initial displacement does not affect the
time period of your pendulum.
Nowadays most clocks or watches
have an electric circuit with one or more
There is an interesting story about the discovery that the time period of a given
pendulum is constant. You might have heard the name of famous scientist
Galileo Galilie (A.D. 1564 –1642). It is said that once Galileo was sitting in a
church. He noticed that a lamp suspended from the ceiling with a chain was
moving slowly from one side to the other. He was surprised to find that his
pulse beat the same number of times during the interval in which the lamp
completed one oscillation. Galileo experimented with various pendulums to
verify his observation. He found that a pendulum of a given length takes always
the same time to complete one oscillation. This observation led to the
development of pendulum clocks. Winding clocks and wristwatches were
refinements of the pendulum clocks.

Different units of time are used
depending on the need.  For example, it
is convenient to express your age in
years rather than in days or hours.
Similarly, it will not be wise to express
in years the time taken by you to cover
the distance between your home and
your school.
How small or large is a time interval
of one second? The time taken in saying
aloud “two thousand and one” is nearby
one second. Verify it by counting aloud
from “two thousand and one” to “two
thousand and ten”. The pulse of a
normal healthy adult at rest beats about
72 times in a minute that is about 12
times in 10 seconds.  This rate may be
slightly higher for children.
Paheli wondered how time was
measured when pendulum
clocks were not available.
Many time measuring devices were
used in different parts of the world before
the pendulum clocks became popular.
Sundials, water clocks and sand clocks
are some examples of such devices.
Different designs of these devices were
developed in different parts of the world
(Fig. 9.5).
9.4 MEASURING SPEED
Having learnt how to measure time and
distance, you can calculate the speed of
an object. Let us find the speed of a ball
moving along the ground.
Activity 9.3
Draw a straight line on the ground with
chalk powder or lime and ask one of
your friends to stand 1 to 2 m away from
it. Let your friend gently roll a ball along
the ground in a direction perpendicular
to the line. Note the time at the moment
the ball crosses the line and also when
it comes to rest (Fig. 9.6). How much
time does the ball take to come to rest?
The smallest time interval that can be measured with commonly available
clocks and watches is one second. However, now special clocks are available
that can measure time intervals smaller than a second.  Some of these clocks
can measure time intervals as small as one millionth or even one billionth of a
second. You might have heard the terms like microsecond and nanosecond.
One microsecond is one millionth of a second. A nanosecond is one billionth
of a second. Clocks that measure such small time intervals are used for scientific
research. The time measuring devices used in sports can measure time intervals
that are one tenth or one hundredth of a second. On the other hand, times of
historical events are stated in terms of centuries or millenniums. The ages of
stars and planet are often expressed in billions of years. Can you imagine the
range of time intervals that we have to deal with?

Measure the distance between the point
at which the ball crosses the line and
the point where it comes to rest. You
can use a scale or a measuring
tape. Let different groups repeat the
activity. Record the measurements in
Table 9.3. In each case calculate the
speed of the ball.
You may now like to compare your
speed of walking or cycling with that of
your friends. You need to know the
distance of the school from your home
or from some other point. Each one of
you can then measure the time taken
to cover that distance and calculate your
speed. It may be interesting to know who
amongst you is the fastest. Speeds of
some living organisms are given in

that measures the speed.
Table 9.4, in km/h. You can calculate
the speeds in m/s yourself.
Rockets, launching satellites into
earth’s orbit, often attain speeds up to
8 km/s. On the other hand, a tortoise
can move only with a speed of about 8
cm/s. Can you calculate how fast is the
rocket compared with the tortoise?
Once you know the speed of an
object, you can find the distance moved
by it in a given time. All you have to do
is to multiply the speed by time. Thus,
Distance covered = Speed × Time
You can also find the time an object
would take to cover a distance while
moving with a given speed.
You might have seen a meter fitted
on top of a scooter or a motorcycle.
Similarly, meters can be seen on the
dashboards of cars, buses and other
vehicles. Fig. 9.7 shows the dashboard
of a car. Note that one of the meters has
km/h written at one corner. This is
called a speedometer. It records the

another meter that measures the
distance moved by the vehicle. This
meter is known as an odometer.
While going for a school picnic, Paheli
decided to note the reading on the
odometer of the bus after every
30 minutes till the end of the journey.
Later on she recorded her readings in
Table 9.5.
Can you tell how far was the picnic
spot from the school? Can you calculate
the speed of the bus? Looking at the
Table, Boojho asked Paheli whether she
can tell how far they would have
travelled till 9:45 AM. Paheli had no
answer to this question. They went to

of intersection of XOX' and YOY' is
known as the origin O. The two
quantities between which the graph is
drawn are shown along these two axes.
We show the positive values on the
x-axis along OX. Similarly, positive
values on the y-axis are shown along
OY. In this chapter we shall consider
only the positive values of quantities.
Therefore, we shall use only the shaded
part of the graph shown in Fig. 9.11.

we show the time along the x-axis
and the distance along the y-axis.

Choose a scale to represent the
distance and another to represent
the time on the graph. For the motion
of the car scales could be
Time: 1 min = 1 cm
Distance: 1 km = 1 cm

Mark values for the time and the
distance on the respective axes
according to the scale you have
chosen. For the motion of the car
mark the time 1 min, 2 min, … on
the x-axis from the origin O.
Similarly, mark the distance 1 km,
2 km … on the y-axis (Fig. 9.12).

Now you have to mark the points on
the graph paper to represent each
set of values for distance and time.
Observation recorded at S. No. 1
in Table 9.6 shows that at time
0 min the distance moved is also
zero. The point corresponding to this
set of values on the graph will
therefore be the origin itself. After 1
minute, the car has moved a distance
of 1 km. To mark this set of values
look for the point that represents
1 minute on the x-axis. Draw a line
parallel to the y-axis at this point.
Then draw a line parallel to the
x-axis from the point corresponding
to distance 1 km on the y-axis. The
point where these two lines
intersect represents this set of values
on the graph (Fig. 9.12). Similarly,
mark on the graph paper the
points corresponding to different
sets of values.

Fig. 9.12 shows the set of points on
the graph corresponding to positions
of the car at various times.

Join all the points on the graph as
shown in Fig. 9.13. It is a straight
line. This is the distance-time graph
for the motion of the car.

If the distance-time graph is a
straight line, it indicates that the
object is moving with a constant
speed. However, if the speed of the
object keeps changing, the graph can
be of any other shape.

Generally, the choice of scales is not
as simple as in the example given in
Fig. 9.12 and 9.13. We may have to
choose two different scales to represent
the desired quantities on the x-axis and
the y-axis. Let us try to understand this
process with an example.
Let us again consider the motion of
the bus that took Paheli and her friends
to the picnic. The distance covered and
time taken by the bus are shown in
Table 9.5. The total distance covered by
the bus is 80 km. If we decide to choose
a scale 1 km = 1 cm, we shall have to
draw an axis of length 80 cm. This is
not possible on a sheet of paper. On the
other hand, a scale 10 km = 1 cm would
require an axis of length only 8 cm. This
scale is quite convenient. However, the
graph may cover only a small part of
the graph paper.  Some of the points to
be kept in mind while choosing
the most suitable scale for drawing a
graph are:

the difference between the highest
and the lowest values of each
quantity.

the intermediate values of each
quantity, so that with the scale
chosen it is convenient to mark the
values on the graph, and

to utilise the maximum part of the
paper on which the graph is to be
drawn.
Suppose that you are given a graph
paper of size 25 cm × 25 cm. One of the
scales which meets the above conditions
and can accommodate the data of Table
9.5 could be
Distance: 5 km = 1 cm, and
Time: 6 min = 1 cm
Can you now draw the distance-time
graph for the motion of the bus? Is the
graph drawn by you similar to that
shown in Fig. 9.13?

when compared to the data presented
by a table. For example, Table 9.5 gives
information about the distance moved
by the bus only at some definite time
intervals. On the other hand, from the
distance-time graph we can find the
distance moved by the bus at any
instant of time. Suppose we want to
know how much distance the bus had
travelled at 8:15 AM. We mark the point
corresponding to the time (8:15 AM) on
the x-axis (Fig. 9.14). Suppose this point
is A.  Next we draw a line perpendicular
to the x-axis (or parallel to the y-axis) at
point A. We then mark the point, T, on
the graph at which this perpendicular
line intersects it (Fig. 9.14). Next, we
draw a line through the point T parallel
to the x-axis. This intersects the y-axis
at the point B. The distance
corresponding to the point B on the y-
axis, OB, gives us the distance in km
covered by the bus at 8:15 AM. How
much is this distance in km? Can you
now help Paheli to find the distance
moved by the bus at 9:45 AM? Can you
also find the speed of the bus from its

1. You can make your own sundial and use it to mark the time of the day
at your place. First of all find the latitude of your city with the help of an
atlas. Cut out a triangular piece of a cardboard such that its one angle
is equal to the latitude of your place and the angle opposite to it is a
right angle. Fix this piece, called gnomon, vertically along a diameter of
a circular board a shown in Fig. 9.16. One way to fix the gnomon could
be to make a groove along a diameter on the circular board.
Next, select an open space, which receives sunlight for most of the day.
Mark a line on the ground along the North-South direction. Place the
sundial in the sun as shown in Fig. 9.16.  Mark the position of the tip of
the shadow of the gnomon on the circular board as early in the day as
possible, say 8:00 AM. Mark the position of the tip of the shadow every
hour throughout the day. Draw lines to connect each point marked by
you with the centre of the base of the gnomon as shown in Fig. 9.16.
Extend the lines on the circular board up to its periphery. You can use
this sundial to read the time of the day at your place. Remember that
the gnomon should always be placed in the North-South direction as
shown in Fig. 9.16.

Did you know?
The time-keeping services in India are provided by the National Physical
Laboratory, New Delhi. The clock they use can measure time intervals
with an accuracy of one-millionth of a second. The most accurate clock
in the world has been developed by the National Institute of Standards
and Technology in the U.S.A. This clock will lose or gain one second after
running for 20 million years.

2. Collect information about time-measuring devices that were used in
the ancient times in different parts of the world. Prepare a brief write up
on each one of them. The write up may include the name of the device,
the place of its origin, the period when it was used, the unit in which
the time was measured by it and a drawing or a photograph of the
device, if available.
3. Make a model of a sand clock which can measure a time interval of 2
minutes (Fig. 9.17).
4. You can perform an interesting activity when you visit a park to ride a
swing. You will require a watch. Make the swing oscillate without
anyone sitting on it. Find its time period in the same way as you did for
the pendulum. Make sure that there are no jerks in the motion of the
swing. Ask one of your friends to sit on the swing. Push
it once and let it swing naturally.  Again measure its time period.
Repeat the activity with different persons sitting on the swing. Compare
the time period of the swing measured in different cases. What
conclusions do you draw from this activity?
