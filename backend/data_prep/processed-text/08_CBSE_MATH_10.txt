10.1  Introduction
Do you know?
Mass of earth is 5,970,000,000,000, 000, 000, 000, 000 kg. We have
already learnt in earlier class how to write such large numbers more
conveniently using exponents, as, 5.97 × 1024 kg.
We read 1024 as 10 raised to the power 24.
We know
25 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 2
and
2m = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × ... × 2 × 2 ...  (m times)
  Let us now find what is 2– 2   is equal to?
10.2  Powers with Negative Exponents
You know that,
102 = 10 × 10 = 100
101 = 10 = 100
10
100 = 1 = 10

10– 1 = ?
Continuing the above pattern we get,10– 1 = 1

Let us see how to express 1425.36 in expanded form in a similar way.

10.4 Use of Exponents to Express Small Numbers
in Standard Form
Observe the following facts.
1. The distance from the Earth to the Sun is 149,600,000,000 m.
2. The speed of light is 300,000,000 m/sec.
3. Thickness of Class VII Mathematics book is 20 mm.
4. The average diameter of a Red Blood Cell is 0.000007 mm.
5. The thickness of human hair is in the range of 0.005 cm to 0.01 cm.
6. The distance of moon from the Earth is 384, 467, 000 m (approx).
7. The size of a plant cell is 0.00001275 m.
8. Average radius of the Sun is 695000 km.
9. Mass of propellant in a space shuttle solid rocket booster is 503600 kg.
10. Thickness of a piece of paper is 0.0016 cm.
11. Diameter of a wire on a computer chip is 0.000003 m.
12. The height of Mount Everest is 8848 m.
Observe that there are few numbers which we can read like 2 cm, 8848 m,
6,95,000 km. There are some large
numbers like 150,000,000,000 m and
some very small numbers like
0.000007 m.
Identify very large and very small
numbers from the above facts and
write them in the adjacent table:
We have learnt how to express
very large numbers in standard form
in the previous class.
For example: 150,000,000,000 = 1.5 × 1011
Now, let us try to express 0.000007 m in standard form.

10.4.1  Comparing very large and very small numbers
The diameter of the Sun is 1.4 × 109 m and the diameter of the Earth is 1.2756 × 107 m.
Suppose you want to compare the diameter of the Earth, with the diameter of the Sun.
Diameter of the Sun = 1.4 × 109 m
Diameter of the earth = 1.2756 × 107 m
Therefore

 which is approximately 100
So, the diameter of the Sun is about 100 times the diameter of the earth.
Let us compare the size of a Red Blood cell which is 0.000007 m to that of a plant cell which
is 0.00001275 m.
Size of Red Blood cell = 0.000007 m = 7 × 10– 6 m
Size of plant cell = 0.00001275 = 1.275 × 10– 5 m

Mass of earth is 5.97 × 1024 kg and mass of moon is 7.35 × 1022 kg. What is the
total mass?
Total mass = 5.97 × 1024 kg + 7.35 × 1022 kg.
= 5.97 × 100 × 1022 + 7.35 × 1022
= 597 × 1022 + 7.35 × 1022
= (597 + 7.35) × 1022
= 604.35 × 1022 kg.
The distance between Sun and Earth is 1.496 × 1011m and the distance between
Earth and Moon is 3.84 × 108m.
During solar eclipse moon comes in between Earth and Sun.
At that time what is the distance between Moon and Sun.
When we have to add numbers in
standard form, we convert them into
numbers with the same exponents.

(v) 31860000000
2. Express the following numbers in usual form.
(i) 3.02 × 10– 6
(ii) 4.5 × 104
(iii) 3 × 10– 8
(iv) 1.0001 × 109
(v) 5.8 × 1012
(vi) 3.61492 × 106
3. Express the number appearing in the following statements in standard form.
(i) 1 micron is equal to 
1
1000000  m.
(ii) Charge of an electron is 0.000,000,000,000,000,000,16 coulomb.
(iii) Size of a bacteria is 0.0000005 m
(iv) Size of a plant cell is 0.00001275 m
(v) Thickness of a thick paper is 0.07 mm
4. In a stack there are 5 books each of thickness 20mm and 5 paper sheets each of
thickness 0.016 mm. What is the total thickness of the stack.
Again we need to convert
numbers in standard form into
 a numbers with the same
exponents.
WHAT HAVE WE DISCUSSED?
1. Numbers with negative exponents obey the following laws of exponents.
(a) am × an = am+n
(b) am ÷ an = am–n
(c) (am)n = amn
(d) am × bm = (ab)m
(e) a0 = 1

2. Very small numbers can be expressed in standard form using negative exponents.
