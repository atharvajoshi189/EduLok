Reproduction in Plants

T
o produce its kind is a
characteristic of all living
organisms. You have already
learnt this in Class VI. The production
of new individuals from their parents is
known as reproduction. But, how do
plants reproduce? There are different
modes of reproduction in plants which
we shall learn in this chapter.
8.1 MODES OF REPRODUCTION
In Class VI you learnt about different
parts of a flowering plant. Try to list the
various parts of a plant and write the
functions of each. Most plants have
roots, stems and leaves. These are called
the vegetative parts of a plant. After a
certain period of growth, most plants
bear flowers. You may have seen the
mango trees flowering in spring. It is
these flowers that give rise to juicy
mango fruit we enjoy in summer. We eat
the fruits and usually discard the seeds.
Seeds germinate and form new plants.
So, what is the function of flowers in
plants? Flowers perform the function of
reproduction in plants. Flowers are the
reproductive parts.
There are several ways by which
plants produce their offspring. These are
categorised into two types: (i) asexual,
and (ii) sexual reproduction. In asexual
reproduction plants can give rise to new
plants without seeds, whereas in sexual
Asexual reproduction
In asexual reproduction new plants are
obtained without production of seeds.
Vegetative propagation
It is a type of asexual reproduction in
which new plants are produced from
roots, stems, leaves and buds. Since
reproduction is through the vegetative
parts of the plant, it is known as
vegetative propagation.
Activity 8.1
Cut a branch of rose or champa with a
node. This piece of branch is termed a
cutting. Bury the cutting in the soil. A
node is a part of the stem/branch at
which a leaf arises (Fig. 8.1). Water the
cutting every day and observe its
growth. Observe and record the number
of days taken for roots to come out and

by growing money plant in a jar of water
and record your observations.
Likewise you can also grow ginger
(Fig. 8.3) or turmeric.
Bryophyllum (sprout leaf plant) has
buds in the margins of leaves (Fig. 8.4).
If a leaf of this plant falls on a moist

developing into flowers. Apart from
flower buds, there are buds in the axil
(point of attachment of the leaf at the
node) of leaves which develop into
shoots. These buds are called vegetative
buds (Fig. 8.2). A bud consists of a short
stem

which

overlapping leaves are present. Vegetative
buds can also give rise to new plants.
Activity 8.2
Take a fresh potato. Observe the scars
on it with the help of a magnifying glass.
You may find bud(s) in them. These scars
are also called “eyes”. Cut the potato
into small portions, each with an eye
and bury them in the soil. Water the
pieces regularly for a few days and
observe their progress. What do you find?

container with some water. Add a
spoonful of sugar and shake to dissolve
it. Keep it in the warm part of a room.

detached part can grow into a new
plant.

Boojho wants to know if
there is any advantage of
vegetative propagation.
Plants produced by vegetative
propagation take less time to grow and
bear flowers and fruits earlier than those
produced from seeds. The new plants
are exact copies of the parent plant, as
they are produced from a single parent.
Later in this chapter you will learn
that plants produced by sexual
reproduction have characters of both the
parents. Plants produce seeds as a result
of sexual reproduction.
Budding
You have already learnt about the tiny
organisms like yeast can be seen only
under a microscope. These grow and
multiply every few hours if sufficient
nutrients are made available to them.
Remember that yeast is a single-celled
organism. Let us see how they
reproduce?
The small bulb-like projection
coming out from the yeast cell is called
a bud. The bud gradually grows and
gets detached from the parent cell and
forms a new yeast cell. The new yeast
cell grows, matures and produces more
yeast cells. Sometimes, another  bud
arises from the bud forming a chain of
buds. If this process continues, a large
number of yeast cells are produced in a
short time.
Fragmentation
You might have seen slimy green
patches in ponds, or in other stagnant
water bodies. These are the algae. When

air. As they are very light they can cover
long distances.
Spores are asexual reproductive
bodies. Each spore is covered by a
hard protective coat to withstand
unfavourable conditions such as high
temperature and low humidity. So
they can survive for a long time. Under
favourable conditions, a spore
germinates and develops into a new
individual. Plants such as moss and
ferns (Fig. 8.8) also reproduce by means
of spores.
12.2 SEXUAL REPRODUCTION

a flower. You know that the flowers are

fragmentation. An alga breaks up into
two or more fragments. These fragments
or pieces grow into new individuals
(Fig. 8.6). This process continues and
they cover a large area in a short period
of time.

protective coat which prevents them
from drying up. Since pollen grains are
light, they can be carried by wind or

Flowers which contain either only

unisexual flowers. Flowers which
contain both stamens and pistil are
called bisexual flowers. Corn, papaya
and cucumber produce unisexual
flowers, whereas mustard, rose and

Could you identify the anther and

Anther contains pollen grains which
produce male gametes. A pistil consists
of stigma, style and ovary. Ovary
contains one or more ovules. The
female gamete or the egg is formed in

reproduction a male and a female
gamete fuse to form a zygote.

water. Insects visit flowers and carry
away pollen on their bodies. Some of
the pollen lands on the stigma of a flower
of the same kind. The transfer of pollen
from the anther to the stigma of a flower
is called pollination.  If the pollen lands
on the stigma of the same flower or
another flower of the same plant, it is
called self-pollination. When the pollen
of a flower lands on the stigma of a flower
of a different plant of the same kind, it
is called cross-pollination [Fig. 8.10 (a)
and (b)].
Fertilisation

the gametes is called a zygote. The

gametes (to form a zygote) is called
fertilisation (Fig. 8.11). The zygote
develops into an embryo.
8.3 FRUITS AND SEED FORMATION
After fertilisation, the ovary grows into
a fruit and other parts of the flower fall
off. The fruit is the ripened ovary. The
seeds develop from the ovules. The seed
contains an embryo enclosed in a
protective seed coat.
Some fruits are fleshy and juicy such
as mango and orange. Some fruits are
hard like almonds and walnuts
[Fig. 8.12 (a) and (b)].
8.4 SEED DISPERSAL
In nature same kind of plants grow at
different places. This happens because
seeds are dispersed to different places.
Sometimes after a walk through a forest
or a field or a park, you may have found
seeds or fruits sticking to your clothes.

Did you try to observe how these seeds
were clinging to your clothes?
What do you think will happen if all
seeds of a plant were to fall at the same
place and grow there? There would be
severe competition for sunlight, water,
minerals and space. As a result the seeds
would not grow into healthy plants.
Plants benefit by seed dispersal. It
prevents competition between the plant
and its own seedlings for sunlight, water
and minerals. It also enables the plants
to invade new habitats for wider
distribution.
Seeds and fruits of plants are carried
away by wind, water and animals.
Winged seeds such as those of drumstick
and maple [Fig. 8.13 (a) and (b)], light
seeds of grasses or hairy seeds of aak
(Madar) and hairy fruit of sunflower
[Fig. 8.14 (a), (b)], get blown off with the
wind to far away places. Some seeds are
dispersed by water. These fruits or seeds
usually develop floating ability in the
form of spongy or fibrous outer coat as
in coconut. Some seeds are dispersed by
animals, especially spiny seeds with
hooks which get attached to the bodies
of animals and are carried to distant
places. Examples are Xanthium
(Fig. 8.15) and Urena.
Some seeds are dispersed when the
fruits burst with sudden jerks. The seeds
are scattered far from the parent plant.
This happens in the case of castor and
balsam.

What you have learnt

All organisms multiply or reproduce their own kind.

In plants there are two modes of reproduction, asexual and sexual.

There are several methods of asexual reproduction such as
fragmentation, budding, spore formation and vegetative propagation.

Sexual reproduction involves the fusion of male and female gametes.

In vegetative propagation new plants are produced from different
vegetative parts such as leaves, stems and roots.

Flower is the reproductive part of a plant.

A flower may be unisexual with either the male or the female reproductive
parts.

A bisexual flower has both the male and the female reproductive parts.

The male gametes are found inside the pollen grains and female gametes
are found in the ovule.

Pollination is the process of transfer of pollen grains from the anther of
one flower to the stigma of the same or another flower.

Pollination is of two types, self-pollination and cross-pollination. In
self-pollination, pollen grains are transferred from the anther to the
stigma of the same flower. In cross-pollination, pollen grains are
transferred from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower
of the same kind.

Pollination takes place in plants with the help of wind, water and insects.

The fusion of male and female gametes is called fertilisation.

Fertilised egg is called zygote. Zygote develops into an embryo.

Fruit is the mature ovary whereas ovule develops into a seed, which
contains the developing embryo.

Seed dispersal is aided by wind, water and animals.

Seed dispersal helps the plants to (i) prevent overcrowding, (ii) avoid
competition for sunlight, water and minerals and (iii) invade new habitats.

Extended Learning—Activities and Projects
1. Make your own cactus garden by collecting pieces cut from different
kinds of cacti. Grow the variety in one single flat container or in
separate pots.
2. Visit a fruit market and collect as many local fruits as possible. If many
fruits are not available, you can collect tomatoes and cucumbers (these
are fruits, though we use them as vegetables). Make drawings of the
different fruits. Split the fruits and examine the seeds within. Look for
any special characteristics in the fruits and their seeds.
You can visit a library also to learn about this.
3. Think of ten different fruit-bearing plants. Remember that many
vegetables are also fruits of the plants. Discuss with your teacher,
parents, farmers, fruit growers and agricultural experts (if available
nearby) and find out the manner of their dispersal. Present your data
in the form of a table as shown below:
4. Suppose there is one member of a particular kind of organism in a
culture dish, which doubles itself in one hour through asexual
reproduction. Work out the number of members of that kind of organism
which will be present in the culture dish after ten hours. Such a colony
of individuals arising from one parent is called a “clone”.
