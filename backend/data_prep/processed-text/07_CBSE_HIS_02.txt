The Emergence of New Dynasties
By the seventh century, there were big landlords or 
warrior chiefs in different regions of the subcontinent. 
Existing kings often acknowledged them as their 
subordinates or 
 They 
were expected to bring gifts for their 
kings or overlords, be present at 
their courts and provide them with 
military support. As 
 gained 
power and wealth, they declared 
themselves to be 
, 
 (the great 
lord of a “circle” or region) and so 
independence from their overlords. 
One such instance was that of 
the Rashtrakutas in the Deccan. 
Initially they were subordinate to 
the Chalukyas of Karnataka. In the 
mid-eighth century, Dantidurga, a 
Rashtrakuta chief, overthrew his Chalukya overlord and 
performed a ritual called 
 (literally, the 
golden womb). When this ritual was performed with 
the help of Brahmanas, it was thought to lead to the 
not one by birth.   
In other cases, men from enterprising families 
used their military skills to carve out kingdoms. For 
instance, the Kadamba Mayurasharman and the 
Gurjara-Pratihara Harichandra were Brahmanas who 
gave up their traditional professions and took to arms, 
successfully establishing kingdoms in Karnataka and 
Rajasthan respectively.  
Administration in the Kingdoms
Many of these new kings adopted high-sounding 
titles such as 
 (great king, overlord 
of kings), 
 (lord of the three 
worlds) and so on. However, in spite of such claims, 
Do you think 
being born as 
a Kshatriya was 
important in 
order to become 
a ruler during this 
period?

they often shared power with their 
 as well as 
with associations of peasants, traders and Brahmanas.
In each of these states, resources were obtained 
from the producers – that is, peasants, cattle-keepers, 
artisans – who were often persuaded or compelled to 
these were claimed as “rent” due to a lord who asserted 
that he owned the land. Revenue was also collected 
from traders. 
Four hundred taxes!
The inscriptions of the Cholas who ruled in Tamil 
Nadu refer to more than 400 terms for different kinds 
of taxes. The most frequently mentioned tax is vetti, 
taken not in cash but in the form of forced labour, and 
kadamai, or land revenue. There were also taxes on 
thatching the house, the use of a ladder to climb palm 
trees, a cess on succession to family property, etc.  
Are any such taxes collected today?  
establishment, as well as for the construction of temples 
 
turn expected to lead to the acquisition of wealth in the 
form of plunder, and access to land as well as trade routes.
The functionaries for collecting revenue were 
generally recruited from influential families, and 
positions were often hereditary. This was true about 
the army as well. In many cases, close relatives of the 
king held these positions.
Prashastis and Land Grants 
contain details that may not be literally 
true. But they tell us how rulers wanted to depict 
themselves – as valiant, victorious warriors, for 
example. These were composed by learned Brahmanas, 
who occasionally helped in the administration.

In what ways 
was this form of 
administration 
different from 
the present-day 
system?

?
The “achievements” of Nagabhata
Many rulers described their achievements in prashastis 
(you read about the prashasti of the Gupta ruler 
Samudragupta last year). 
One prashasti, written in Sanskrit and found in 
Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, describes the exploits of 
Nagabhata, a Pratihara king, as follows:
The kings of Andhra, Saindhava (Sind), Vidarbha (part of 
Maharashtra) and Kalinga (part of Orissa) fell before him 
even as he was a prince …
He won a victory over Chakrayudha (the ruler of Kanauj) …
He defeated the king of Vanga (part of Bengal), Anarta (part 
of Gujarat), Malava (part of Madhya Pradesh), Kirata (forest 
peoples), Turushka (Turks), Vatsa, Matsya (both kingdoms 
in north India) …
Kings often rewarded Brahmanas by grants of land. 
These were recorded on copper plates, which were given 
to those who received the land.

What was given with the land
This is a part of the Tamil section of a land grant given 
by the Cholas: 
We have demarcated the boundaries of the land by making 
earthen embankments, as well as by planting thorny bushes. 
This is what the land contains: fruit-bearing trees, water, 
land, gardens and orchards, trees, wells, open spaces, 
pasture-land, a village, anthills, platforms, canals, ditches, 
and deep lakes. 
He who receives the land can collect taxes from it. He can 
on betel-leaves, that on woven cloth, as well as on vehicles. 
He can build large rooms, with upper stories made of baked 
bricks, he can get large and small wells dug, he can plant trees 
and thorny bushes, if necessary, he can get canals constructed 
for irrigation. He should ensure that water is not wasted, and 
that embankments are built.

poem containing the history of kings who ruled over 
Kashmir. It was composed by an author named 
Kalhana. He used a variety of sources, including 
inscriptions, documents, eyewitness accounts and 
earlier histories, to write his account. Unlike the 
writers of 
, he was often critical about rulers 
and their policies.
Warfare for Wealth 
You may have noticed that each of these ruling

prized area was the city of Kanauj in the Ganga 
valley. For centuries, rulers belonging to the Gurjara-
Pratihara, Rashtrakuta and Pala dynasties fought for 
control over Kanauj. Because there were three “parties” 
it as the “tripartite struggle”. 
Rulers also tried to demonstrate their power and 
resources by building large temples. So, when they 
attacked one another’s kingdoms, they often chose to 
target temples, which were sometimes extremely rich.
One such ruler is Mahmud of Ghazni, Afghanistan. 
He raided the subcontinent 17 times (1000–1025) with 
a religious motive. His targets were wealthy temples, 
including that of Somnath, Gujarat. Much of the wealth 
Mahmud carried away was used to create a splendid 
capital city at Ghazni.
Other kings who engaged in warfare included the 
Chahamanas, later known as the Chauhans, who 
ruled over the region around Delhi and Ajmer. They 
attempted to expand their control to the west and 
the east, where they were opposed by the Chalukyas 
of Gujarat and the Gahadavalas of western Uttar 
Pradesh. The Chahamana ruler was Prithviraja III 
(1168 –1192), who defeated a Turk ruler named Sultan 
Muhammad Ghori in 1191, but lost to him the very 
next year, in 1192. 
A Closer Look: The Cholas 
From Uraiyur to Thanjavur 
How did the Cholas rise to power? A minor 
chiefly family known as the Muttaraiyar held 
power in the Kaveri delta. They were subordinate 
to the Pallava kings of Kanchipuram. Vijayalaya, 
Cholas from Uraiyur, captured the delta from the 
Muttaraiyar in the middle of the ninth century. He 
built the town of Thanjavur and a temple for goddess 
Nishumbhasudini there.

may have wanted

territories.

Look at Map 1 and 
suggest reasons 
why these rulers

Kanauj and the 
Ganga valley. 


22
The successors of Vijayalaya conquered neighbouring 
regions and the kingdom grew in size and power. The 
Pandyan and the Pallava territories to the south and 
north were made part of this kingdom. Rajaraja I, 
considered the most powerful Chola ruler, became 
areas. He also reorganised the administration of 
the empire. Rajaraja’s son Rajendra I continued his 
these expeditions.
Splendid Temples and Bronze Sculpture

Chola temples often became the nuclei of settlements 
which grew around them. These were centres of craft 
production. Temples were also endowed with land by 
rulers as well as by others. The produce of this land 
went into maintaining all the specialists who worked 
at the temple and very often lived near it – priests, 
garland makers, cooks, sweepers, musicians, dancers, 
etc. In other words, temples were not only places of 
worship; they were the centres of economic, social and 
cultural life. 
Amongst the crafts associated with temples, the 
making of bronze images was the most distinctive. 
Chola bronze images are considered amongst the 
sometimes images were made of devotees as well. 


24
Agriculture and Irrigation 
Many of the achievements of the Cholas were 
made possible through new developments in 
the river Kaveri branches off into several 
small channels before emptying into the 
frequently, depositing fertile soil on 
their banks. Water from the channels 
also provides the necessary moisture 
for agriculture, particularly the 
cultivation of rice.
Although agriculture had 
developed earlier in other 
parts of Tamil Nadu, it was 
century that this area was opened 
up for large-scale cultivation. 
Forests had to be cleared in some 
regions; land had to be levelled in other 
areas. In the delta region, embankments 
canals had to be constructed to carry 
crops were grown in a year.
In many cases it was necessary to 
water crops artificially. A variety of 
methods were used for irrigation. In some 
areas wells were dug. In other places 
huge tanks were constructed to collect 
rainwater. Remember that irrigation 
works require planning – organising

labour and resources, maintaining these works and 
deciding on how water is to be shared. Most of the 
new rulers, as well as people living in villages, took an 
active interest in these activities.
The Administration of the Empire 
of peasants, known as 
, became prosperous 
with the spread of irrigation agriculture. Groups 
of such villages formed larger units called 
. 
The village council and the 
 performed several 
administrative functions including dispensing justice 
and collecting taxes. 
Rich peasants exercised considerable control 
over the affairs of the 
 under the supervision 
of the central Chola government. The Chola kings 
gave some rich landowners titles like 
 
(a 
 or peasant serving three kings), 
 
(chief), etc., as markers of respect, and entrusted them

We have seen that Brahmanas often received land 
grants or 
. As a result, a large number of 
Brahmana settlements emerged in the Kaveri valley 
as in other parts of south India.  
Each 
was looked after by an assembly 
or 
 of prominent Brahmana landholders. These 
recorded in detail in inscriptions, often on the stone 
walls of temples. Associations of traders known as 
 also occasionally performed administrative 
functions in towns. 
Inscriptions from Uttaramerur in Chingleput 
district, Tamil Nadu, provide details of the way in 
which the 
was organised. The 
 had 
separate committees to look after irrigation works, 
gardens, temples, etc. Names of those eligible to 
be members of these committees were written on 
small tickets of palm leaf; these tickets were put 
into an earthenware pot, from which a young boy 
was asked to take out the tickets, one by one for 
each committee. 
Types of land
Chola inscriptions mention several categories of land:
vellanvagai 
land of non-Brahmana peasant proprietors
brahmadeya

 Inscriptions and texts
Who could be a member of a sabha? The Uttaramerur 
inscription lays down:
All those who wish to become members of the sabha should 
be owners of land from which land revenue is collected. 
They should have their own homes. 
They should be between 35 and 70 years of age. 
They should have knowledge of the Vedas. 
They should be well-versed in administrative matters         
and honest. 
If anyone has been a member of any committee in the last 
three years, he cannot become a member of another committee. 
Anyone who has not submitted his accounts, and those of 
his relatives, cannot contest the elections. 
While inscriptions tell us about kings and powerful men, 
here is an excerpt from the Periyapuranam, a twelfth- 
century Tamil work, which informs us about the lives 
of ordinary men and women.
On the outskirts of Adanur was a small hamlet of Pulaiyas        
(a name used for a social group considered “outcastes” by 
Brahmanas and Vellalas), studded with small huts under 
old thatches and inhabited by agrarian labourers engaged 
in menial occupations. In the thresholds of the huts covered 
with strips of leather, little chickens moved about in groups; 
dark children who wore bracelets of black iron were prancing 
about, carrying little puppies … In the shade of the marudu 
(arjuna) trees, a female labourer put her baby to sleep on a 
sheet of leather; there were mango trees from whose branches 
drums were hanging; and under the coconut palms, in little 
hollows on the ground, tiny-headed bitches lay after whelping. 
The red-crested cocks crowed before dawn calling the brawny 
Pulaiyar (plural) to their day’s work; and by day, under the 
shade of the kanji tree spread the voice of the wavy-haired 
Pulaiya women singing as they were husking paddy …
