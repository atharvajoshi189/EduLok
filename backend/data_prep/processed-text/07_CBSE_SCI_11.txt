This activity showed that
light travels along straight lines.
How can we change the path
of light? Do you know, what
happens when light falls on a
polished or a shiny surface?
11.2  REFLECTION OF LIGHT
One way to change the direction
of light is to let it fall on a shiny
surface. For example, a shining
stainless steel plate or a shining
steel spoon can change the
direction of light. The surface of
water can also act like a mirror
and change the path of light.
Have you ever seen the reflection
of trees or buildings in water
(Fig. 11.3)?
Any polished or a shiny surface can
act as a mirror. What happens when
light falls on a mirror?
You have learnt in Class VI that a
mirror changes the direction of light that
falls on it. This change of direction by a
mirror is called reflection of light. Can
you recall the activity in which you got
the light of a torch reflected from a
mirror? Let us perform a similar activity.

Fix a plane mirror strip vertically on the
chart paper (Fig. 11.5). Now direct the
beam of light on the mirror from the
torch with slits. Place the torch in such
a way that its light is seen along the
chart paper on the board. Now adjust
its position so that the light from the
torch strikes the plane mirror at an
angle (Fig. 11.5).
Does the mirror change the direction
of light that falls on it? Now move the
torch slightly to either side. Do you find
any change in the direction of reflected
light?
Look into the mirror along the
direction of the reflected light. Do you
see the slits in the mirror? This is the
image of the slits.
This activity shows how light gets
reflected from a plane mirror.
Let us play around with the images
formed in mirrors and know a little more
about them.

you agree with him?
CAUTION
Handle the lighted candle with care.
It is better if this activity is performed
in the presence of a teacher or an elder
person.
Place a lighted candle in front of a plane
mirror. Try to see the flame of the candle
in the mirror. It appears as if a similar
candle is placed behind the mirror. The
candle, which appears behind the
mirror, is the image of the candle formed
by the mirror (Fig. 11.6). The candle

Activity 11.3
Take a chess board. If a chess board is
not available, draw on a chart paper 64
(8×8) squares of equal size. Draw a thick
line in the middle of the paper. Fix a
plane mirror vertically on this line. Place
any small object, such as a pencil
sharpner, at the boundary of the third
square counting from the mirror
(Fig. 11.7). Note the position of the
image. Now shift the object to the
boundary of the fourth square. Again
note the position of the image. Did you
find any relation between the distance
of the image from the mirror and that of
the object in front of it?
Was the image upright in each case?
Did the flame appear on top of the candle
as in the object? Such an image is called
erect. An image formed by a plane
mirror is erect and of the same size as
the object.
Now place a vertical screen behind
the mirror. Try to obtain the image of
the candle on this screen. Can you get
the image on the screen? Now place the

11.4 PLAYING WITH SPHERICAL
MIRRORS
Paheli and Boojho were waiting for their
dinner. Boojho lifted a stainless steel
plate and saw his image in it. Oh! This
plate acts as a plane mirror. My image
is erect and is of the same size. Paheli
saw her image using the back of a steel
spoon. “Boojho look here! I can also see
my erect image though it is smaller in
size. This spoon also acts as a mirror of
some kind”, said Paheli.
You can also use a spoon or any
curved shining surface to see your
image.
Activity 11.5
Take a stainless steel spoon. Bring the
outer side of the spoon near your face
and look into it. Do you see your image
in it (Fig. 11.10)? Is this image different
from what you see in a plane mirror? Is
this image erect? Is the size of the image
the same, smaller or larger?

spoon

Now look at your image using the
inner side of the spoon. This time you
may find that your image is erect and
larger in size. If you increase the distance
of the spoon from your face, you may
see your image inverted (Fig. 11.11). You
can also compare the image of your pen
or pencil instead of your face.
The curved shining surface of a spoon
acts as a mirror. The most common
example of a curved mirror is a spherical
mirror.
If the reflecting surface of a spherical
mirror is concave, it is called a concave
mirror. If the reflecting surface is convex,
then it is a convex mirror (Fig. 11.12).

The inner surface of a spoon acts like
a concave mirror, while its outer surface
acts like a convex mirror.
We know that the image of an object
formed by a plane mirror cannot be
obtained on a screen. Let us investigate
if it is also true for the image formed by
a concave mirror.
Activity 11.6
Fig. 11.14  A concave mirror forms a real image
of the sun
Take a concave mirror. Hold it facing
the Sun. Try to get the light reflected by
the mirror on a sheet of paper. Adjust
the distance of the paper until you get a
sharp bright spot on it (Fig. 11.14). Hold
the mirror and the sheet of paper steady
for a few minutes. Does the paper start
burning?
This bright spot is, in fact, the image
of the Sun. Notice that this image is
formed on a screen. An image formed
on a screen is called a real image.
Recollect that in Activity 11.2 the image
formed by a plane mirror could not be
obtained on a screen. Such an image is
called a virtual image.
Now let us try to obtain on the screen
the image of a candle flame formed by a
concave mirror.

Now move the candle towards the
mirror and place it at different distances
from it. In each case try to obtain the
image on the screen. Record your
observation in Table 11.1. Is it possible
to obtain the image on the screen when
the candle is too close to the mirror
(Fig. 11.16)?
We see that the image formed by a
concave mirror can be smaller or larger
in size than the object. The image may
also be real or virtual.
Concave mirrors are used for many
purposes. You might have seen doctors
using concave mirrors for examining
eyes, ears, nose and throat. Concave
mirrors are also used by dentists
to see an enlarged image of the teeth
(Fig. 11.17). The reflectors of torches,
headlights of cars and scooters are
concave in shape (Fig. 11.18).

11.5  IMAGES FORMED BY LENSES
You might have seen a magnifying glass.
It is used to read very small print
(Fig. 11.21). You might have also used
it to observe the body parts of a
cockroach or an earthworm. The
magnifying glass is actually a type of a lens.
Lenses are widely used in spectacles,
telescopes and microscopes. Try to add
a few more uses of lenses to this list.
Get some lenses. Touch and feel
them. Can you find some difference just
by touching? Those lenses which feel
thicker in the middle than at the edges
are convex lenses [Fig. 11.22 (a)]. Those
which feel thinner in the middle than
at the edges are concave lenses
[Fig. 11.22 (b)]. Notice that the lenses
are transparent and light can pass
through them.
CAUTION
It is dangerous to look through a lens
at the Sun or a bright light. You
should also be careful not to focus
sunlight with a convex lens on any
part of your body.

Activity 11.12
Take a circular cardboard disc of about
10 cm diameter. Divide this disc into
seven segments. Paint the seven
rainbow colours on these segments
as shown in Fig. 11.31 (a). You can
also paste, coloured papers on
these segments. Make a small hole
at the centre of the disc. Fix the
disc loosely on the tip of a refill of a
ball pen. Ensure that the disc rotates
freely [Fig. 11.31 (a)]. Rotate the disc
in the daylight. When the disc is
rotated fast, the colours get mixed
together and the disc appears
to be whitish [Fig. 11.31 (b)]. Such
a disc is popularly known as Newton’s
disc.

to have done just that more than two thousand years ago. When the
Romans attacked Syracuse, a coastal city-state in Greece, Archimedes used
mirrors arranged as shown in Fig. 11.34. The mirrors could be moved in any
direction. They were positioned such that they reflected the sunlight on the
Roman soldiers. The soldiers were dazzled by the sunlight. They did not
know what was happening. They got confused and ran away. This was an
example of triumph of ideas over military might.
