ou saw in Chapters 2, 3 and 4 how kingdoms 
rose and fell. Even as this was happening, new arts, 
and villages. Over the centuries important political, 
social and economic developments had taken place. 
But social change was not the same everywhere, 
because different kinds of societies evolved 
differently. It is important to understand 
how and why this happened.
In large parts of the subcontinent, society 
was already divided according to the rules 
of 
. These rules, as prescribed by the 
Brahmanas, were accepted by the rulers 
of large kingdoms. The difference between 
the high and low, and between the rich and 
poor, increased. Under the Delhi Sultans 
and the Mughals, this hierarchy between 
social classes grew further. 
Beyond Big Cities: Tribal 
Societies 
There were, however, other kinds of 
societies as well. Many societies in the 
subcontinent did not follow the social rules 
and rituals prescribed by the Brahmanas. 
Nor were they divided into numerous 
unequal classes. Such societies are often 
called tribes.

Members of each tribe were united by kinship 
bonds. Many tribes obtained their livelihood from 
agriculture. Others were hunter-gatherers or herders. 
Most often they combined these activities to make 
full use of the natural resources of the area in which 
they lived. Some tribes were nomadic and moved 
from one place to another. A tribal group controlled 
land and pastures jointly, and divided these amongst 
households according to its own rules. 
Many large tribes thrived in different parts of the 
subcontinent. They usually lived in forests, hills, 
clashed with the more powerful caste-based societies. 
In various ways, the tribes retained their freedom and 
preserved their separate culture. 
But the caste-based and tribal societies also 
depended on each other for their diverse needs. This 
caused both societies to change.
Who were Tribal People? 
Contemporary historians and travellers give very 
scanty information about tribes. A few exceptions 
apart, tribal people did not keep written records. But 
they preserved rich customs and oral traditions. These 
were passed down to each new generation. Present-
day historians have started using such oral traditions 
to write tribal histories. 
Tribal people were found in almost every region of 
varied at different points of time. Some powerful tribes 
controlled large territories. In Punjab, the Khokhar 
fourteenth centuries. Later, the Gakkhars became 
more important. Their chief, Kamal Khan Gakkhar, 
was made a noble (
) by Emperor Akbar. In 
Multan and Sind, the Langahs and Arghuns dominated 
extensive regions before they were subdued by the 
Mughals. The Balochis were another large and powerful

tribe in the north-west. They were divided into many 
smaller clans under different chiefs. In the western 
Himalaya lived the shepherd tribe of Gaddis. The 
distant north-eastern part of the subcontinent too was 
entirely dominated by tribes – the Nagas, Ahoms and 
many others.
In many areas of present-day Bihar and Jharkhand, 
Chero chiefdoms had emerged by the twelfth century. 
Raja Man Singh, Akbar’s famous general, attacked 
and defeated the Cheros in 1591. A large amount of 
booty was taken from them, but they were not entirely 
subdued. Under Aurangzeb, Mughal forces captured 
many Chero fortresses and subjugated the tribe. The 
Mundas and Santals were among the other important 
tribes that lived in this region and also in Orissa 
and Bengal.

The Maharashtra highlands and 
Karnataka were home to Kolis, 
Berads and numerous others. 
Kolis also lived in many areas of 
Gujarat. Further south there were 
large tribal populations of Koragas, 
Vetars, Maravars and many others.
The large tribe of Bhils was 
spread across western and central 
India. By the late sixteenth 
century, many of them had 
become settled agriculturists and 
some even zamindars. Many Bhil 
clans, nevertheless, remained 
hunter-gatherers. The Gonds were 
found in great numbers across the 
present-day states of Chhattisgarh, 
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and 
Andhra Pradesh.
How Nomads and 
Mobile People Lived
Nomadic pastoralists moved 
over long distances with their 
animals. They lived on milk and 
other pastoral products. They also 
exchanged wool, ghee, etc., with 
settled agriculturists for grain, 
cloth, utensils and other products.

brought such goods to India and the

these to local markets.

They bought and sold these goods as they moved 
from one place to another, transporting them on their 
animals.
The Banjaras were the most important trader-
nomads. Their caravan was called 
. Sultan 
Alauddin Khalji (Chapter 3) used the Banjaras to 
transport grain to the city markets. Emperor Jahangir 
wrote in his memoirs that the Banjaras carried grain 
on their bullocks from different areas and sold it in 
towns. They transported food grain for the Mughal 
army during military campaigns. With a large army 
there could be 100,000 bullocks carrying grain.
The Banjaras
Peter Mundy, an English trader who came to India 
during the early seventeenth century, has described 
the Banjaras:
 In the morning we met a tanda of Banjaras with 14,000 
oxen. They were all laden with grains such as wheat and 
rice ... These Banjaras carry their household – wives and 
children – along with them. One tanda consists of many 
families. Their way of life is similar to that of carriers who 
continuously travel from place to place. They own their oxen. 
They are sometimes hired by merchants, but most commonly 
they are themselves merchants. They buy grain where it is 
cheaply available and carry it to places where it is dearer. 
From there, they again reload their oxen with anything that 
more than 6 or 7 miles a day – that, too, in the cool weather. 
After unloading their oxen, they turn them free to graze as 
there is enough land here, and no one there to forbid them.
Find out how grain is transported from villages 
to cities at present. In what ways is this similar 
to or different from the ways in which the 
Banjaras functioned?

Many pastoral tribes reared and sold animals, 
such as cattle and horses, to the prosperous people. 
Different castes of petty pedlars 
also travelled from village to 
village. They made and 
sold wares such as ropes, 
reeds, straw matting and 
coarse sacks. Sometimes 
mendicants acted as 
wandering merchants. There 
were castes of entertainers who performed in different 
towns and villages for their livelihood. 
Changing Society: New Castes and 
Hierarchies
As the economy and the needs of society grew, people 
with new skills were required. Smaller castes, or 
, emerged within 
. For example, new castes 
appeared amongst the Brahmanas. On the other 
hand, many tribes and social groups were taken 
into caste-based society and given the status of 
. Specialised artisans – smiths, carpenters and 
masons – were also recognised as separate 
 by 
the Brahmanas.

basis for organising society.
Deliberations on jati 
A twelfth-century inscription from Uyyakondan Udaiyar, 
in Tiruchirapalli taluka (in present-day Tamil Nadu), 
describes the deliberations in a sabha (Chapter 2) of 
Brahmanas. 
They deliberated on the status of a group known as 
rathakaras (literally, chariot makers). They laid down 
their occupations, which were to include architecture, 
building coaches and chariots, erecting gateways 
for temples with images in them, preparing wooden 
equipment used to perform sacrifices, building 
mandapas, making jewels for the king.

Among the Kshatriyas, new Rajput clans became 
powerful by the eleventh and twelfth centuries. 
They belonged to different lineages, such as Hunas, 
Chandelas, Chalukyas and others. Some of these, too, 
had been tribes earlier. Many of these clans came to 
be regarded as Rajputs. They gradually replaced the 
older rulers, especially in agricultural areas. Here a 
developed society was emerging, and rulers used their 
wealth to create powerful states. 
The rise of Rajput clans to the position of rulers set 
an example for the tribal people to follow. Gradually, 
with the support of the Brahmanas, many tribes 
became a part of the caste system. But only the leading 
tribal families could join the ruling class. A large 
majority joined the lower 
 of caste society. On the 
other hand, many dominant tribes of Punjab, Sind and 
the North-West Frontier had adopted Islam quite early. 
They continued to reject the caste system. The unequal 
social order, prescribed by orthodox Hinduism, was 
not widely accepted in these areas. 
The emergence of states is closely related to social 
change amongst tribal people. Two examples of this 
important part of our history are described below.
A Closer Look
The Gonds
The Gonds lived in a vast forested region called 
Gondwana – or “country inhabited by Gonds”. They 
practised shifting cultivation. The large Gond tribe 
was further divided into many smaller clans. Each clan 
had its own raja or 
. About the time that the power 
of the Delhi Sultans was declining, a few large Gond 
kingdoms were beginning to dominate the smaller 
Gond chiefs. The 
, a history of Akbar’s 
reign, mentions the Gond kingdom of Garha Katanga 
that had 70,000 villages. 
The administrative system of these kingdoms was 
becoming centralised. The kingdom was divided into

. Each 
 was controlled 
by a particular Gond clan. This 
was further divided into units of 
84 villages called 
. The 
 was subdivided into 
 which were made up of 
12 villages each.
The emergence of large states 
changed the nature of Gond 
society. Their basically equal 
society gradually got divided 
into unequal social classes. 
Brahmanas received land grants 
from the Gond rajas and became 
now wished to be recognised 
as Rajputs. So, Aman Das, the 
Gond raja of Garha Katanga, 
assumed the title of Sangram 
Shah. His son, Dalpat, married 
princess Durgawati, the daughter of Salbahan, the 
Chandel Rajput raja of Mahoba. 
Dalpat, however, died early. Rani Durgawati was very 
her, the kingdom became 
even more extensive. In 
1565, the Mughal forces 
under Asaf Khan attacked 
Garha Katanga. A strong 
resistance was put up by Rani 
Durgawati.  She was defeated 
and preferred to die rather 
than surrender. Her son, too, 
Garha Katanga was a rich 
state. It earned much wealth 
by trapping and exporting wild 
elephants to other kingdoms. 
When the Mughals defeated

the Gonds, they captured a huge booty 
of precious coins and elephants. They 
annexed part of the kingdom and granted 
the rest to Chandra Shah, an uncle of Bir 
Narain. Despite the fall of Garha Katanga, 
the Gond kingdoms survived for some 
time. However, they became much weaker 
and later struggled unsuccessfully against 
the stronger Bundelas and Marathas. 
The Ahoms
The Ahoms migrated to the Brahmaputra 
valley from present-day Myanmar in the 
thirteenth century. They created a new 
state by suppressing the older political 
system of the 
 (landlords). 
During the sixteenth century, they 
annexed the kingdoms of the Chhutiyas 
(1523) and of Koch-Hajo (1581) and 
subjugated many other tribes. The 
Ahoms built a large state, and for this 
quality gunpowder and cannons.
However, the Ahoms faced many 
invasions from the south-west. In 1662, 
the Mughals under Mir Jumla attacked 
the Ahom kingdom. Despite their brave 
defence, the Ahoms were defeated. But 
direct Mughal control over the region 
could not last long. 
The Ahom state depended upon forced 
labour. Those forced to work for the 
state were called 
. A census of the 
population was taken. Each village had 
to send a number of 
 by rotation. 
People from heavily populated areas 
were shifted to less populated places. 
Ahom clans were thus broken up. By the 
administration became quite centralised.

Almost all adult males served in the army during 
war. At other times, they were engaged in building 
dams, irrigation systems and other public works. The 
Ahoms also introduced new methods of rice cultivation.
Ahom society was divided into clans or 
. There 
were very few castes of artisans, so artisans in the 
Ahom areas came from the adjoining kingdoms. A 
 
often controlled several villages. The peasant was given 
land by his village community. Even the king could not 
take it away without the community’s consent.
Originally, the Ahoms worshipped their own tribal 
however, the influence of Brahmanas increased. 
Temples and Brahmanas were granted land by the 
king. In the reign of Sib Singh (1714 –1744), Hinduism 
became the predominant religion.  But the Ahom kings 
did not completely give up their traditional beliefs after 
adopting Hinduism.
Ahom society was very sophisticated. Poets 
and scholars were given land grants. Theatre was 
encouraged. Important works of Sanskrit were 
translated into the local language. Historical Chronicles, 
known as 
language and then in Assamese.
Conclusion
Considerable social change took place in the subcontinent 
during the period we have been examining. 
-based 
society and tribal people constantly interacted with each 
other. This interaction caused both kinds of societies 
to adapt and change. There were many different tribes 
and they took up diverse livelihoods. Over a period of 
time, many of them merged with caste-based society. 
Others, however, rejected both the caste system and 
orthodox Hinduism. Some tribes established extensive 
states with well-organised systems of administration. 
They thus became politically powerful. This brought 
them into conflict with larger and more complex 
kingdoms and empire
