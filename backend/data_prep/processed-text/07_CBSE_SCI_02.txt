Nutrition in Animals

Y
ou have learnt in Chapter 1 that
plants can prepare their own food
by the process of photosynthesis
but animals cannot. Animals get their
food from plants, either directly by
eating plants or indirectly by eating
animals that eat plants. Some animals
eat both plants and animals. Recall that
all organisms including humans require
food for growth, repair and functioning
of the body. Animal nutrition includes
nutrient requirement, mode of intake
of food and its utilisation in the body.
You have studied in Class VI that food
consists of many components. Try to
recall and list them below:

carbohydrates are complex substances.
These complex substances cannot be
utilised as such. So they are broken
down into simpler substances. The

food into simpler substances is called

2.1 DIFFERENT WAYS OF TAKING FOOD
The mode of taking food into the body
varies in different organisms. Bees and
humming-birds suck the nectar of
plants, infants of human and many
other animals feed on mother’s milk.
Snakes like the python swallow the
animals they prey upon. Some aquatic
animals filter tiny food particles floating
nearby and feed upon them.

Fig. 2.1  Starfish
Amazing fact
Starfish feeds on animals covered by
hard shells of calcium carbonate.
After opening the shell, the starfish
pops out its stomach through its
mouth to eat the soft animal inside
the shell. The stomach then goes back
into the body and the food is slowly
digested.
2.2 DIGESTION IN HUMANS
We take in food through the mouth,
digest and utilise it. The unused parts
of the food are defecated. Have you ever
wondered what happens to the food
inside the body? The food passes
through a continuous canal (Fig. 2.2)
which begins at the buccal cavity and
ends at the anus. The canal can be
divided into various compartments:
(1) the buccal cavity, (2) foodpipe or
oesophagus, (3) stomach, (4) small
intestine, (5) large intestine ending in
the rectum and (6) the anus. Is it not a
very long path? These parts together
form the alimentary canal (digestive
tract). The food components gradually
get digested as food travels through the
various compartments. The inner walls
of the stomach and the small intestine,
and the various glands associated with the
canal such as salivary glands, the liver
and the pancreas secrete digestive juices.
The digestive juices convert complex
substances of food into simpler ones. The
digestive tract and the associated glands
together constitute the digestive system.
Now, let us know what happens to
the food in different parts of the digestive
tract.

Milk teeth and permanent teeth
Do you remember about falling of your teeth some years ago? The first set of
teeth grows during infancy and they fall off at the age between six to eight
years. These are termed milk teeth. The second set that replaces them are the
permanent teeth. The permanent teeth may last throughout life or fall off
during old age or due to some dental disease.
the body is called ingestion. We chew
the food with the teeth and break it
down mechanically into small pieces.
Each tooth is rooted in a separate socket
in the gums (Fig. 2.3). Our teeth vary in
appearance and perform different
functions. Accordingly they are given
different names (Fig. 2.3).
Activity 2.2
Wash your hands. Look into the
mirror and count your teeth. Use
your index finger to feel the teeth.
How many kinds of teeth could you
find? Take a piece of an apple or
bread and eat it. Which teeth do
you use for biting and cutting, and
which ones for piercing and tearing?
Also find out the ones that are used for
chewing and grinding?

Boiled rice
Boiled and chewed rice
Sweets and tooth decay
Normally bacteria are present in our mouth but they are not harmful
to us. However, if we do not clean our teeth and mouth after eating,
many harmful bacteria also begin to live and grow in it. These bacteria
break down the sugars present from the leftover food and release
acids (see Chapter 4 to know what an acid is). The acids gradually
damage the teeth (Fig. 2.5). This is called tooth decay. If it is not
treated in time, it causes severe toothache and in extreme cases
results in tooth loss. Chocolates, sweets, soft drinks and other sugar
products are the major culprits of tooth decay.
Therefore, one should clean the teeth with a brush or datun and
dental floss (a special strong thread which is moved between two
teeth to take out trapped food particles) at least twice a day and
rinse the mouth after every meal. Also, one should not put dirty
fingers or any unwashed object in the mouth.

there a change in colour in the test
tubes? Discuss the results with your

it mixes saliva with the food during
chewing and helps in swallowing food.
We also taste food with our tongue. It

The foodpipe/oesophagus
The swallowed food passes into the
foodpipe or oesophagus. Look at Fig. 2.2.
The foodpipe runs along the neck
Sometimes when you eat in a hurry, talk or laugh while eating, you may cough,
get hiccups or a choking sensation. This happens when food particles enter the
windpipe. The windpipe carries air from the nostrils to the lungs. It runs adjacent
to the foodpipe. But inside the throat, air and food share a common passage.
Then how is food prevented from entering the windpipe? During the act of
swallowing a flap-like valve closes the passage of the windpipe and guides the
food into the foodpipe. If, by chance, food particles enter the windpipe, we feel
choked, get hiccups or cough.

The working of the stomach was discovered by a
strange accident. In 1822, a man named Alexis St.
Martin was badly hit by a shot gun. The bullet had
seriously damaged the chest wall and made a hole
in his stomach. He was brought to an American
army doctor William Beaumont. The doctor saved
the patient but he could not close the hole properly
and left it bandaged (Fig. 2.8). Beaumont took it as
a great opportunity to see the inside of the stomach
through the hole. He made some wonderful
observations.
Beaumont found that the stomach was churning
food. Its wall secreted a fluid which could digest
the food. He also observed that the end of the stomach opens into the intestine
only after the digestion of the food inside the stomach is completed.
and the chest. Food is pushed down by
movement of the wall of the foodpipe.
Actually this movement takes place
throughout the alimentary canal and
pushes the food downwards (Fig.  2.7).
At times the food is not accepted by our
stomach and is vomited out. Recall the
instances when you vomited after eating
and think of the reason for it. Discuss
with your parents and teacher.
The stomach
The stomach is a thick-walled bag. Its
shape is like a flattened J and it is the
widest part of the alimentary canal. It
receives food from the food pipe at one
end and opens into the small intestine
at the other.
The inner lining of the stomach
secretes mucous, hydrochloric acid and
digestive juices. The mucous protects
the lining of the stomach. The acid kills
many bacteria that enter along with the
food and makes the medium in the
stomach acidic and helps the digestive
juices to act. The digestive juices break
down the proteins into simpler
substances.
The small intestine
The small intestine is highly coiled and
is about 7.5 metres long. It receives
secretions from the liver and the pancreas.
Besides, its wall also secretes juices.
The liver is a reddish brown gland
situated in the upper part of the
abdomen on the right side. It is the
largest gland in the body. It secretes bile
juice that is stored in a sac called the
gall bladder (Fig. 2.2). The bile plays
an important role in the digestion of fats.
The pancreas is a large cream
coloured gland located just below the
stomach (Fig. 2.2). The pancreatic juice
acts on carbohydrates, fats and proteins
and changes them into simpler forms.

Diarrhoea
Sometime you may have experienced the need to pass watery stool frequently.
This condition is known as diarrhoea. It may be caused by an infection, food
poisoning or indigestion. It is very common in India, particularly among children.
Under severe conditions it can be fatal. This is because of the excessive loss of
water and salts from the body. Diarrhoea should not be neglected. Even before a
doctor is consulted the patient should be given plenty of boiled and cooled water
with a pinch of salt and sugar dissolved in it. This is called Oral Rehydration
Solution (ORS).
The partly digested food now reaches the
lower part of the small intestine where
the intestinal juice completes the
digestion of all components of the food.
The carbohydrates get broken into
simple sugars such as glucose, fats into
fatty acids and glycerol, and proteins
into amino acids.
Absorption in the small
intestine
The digested food can now pass into the
blood vessels in the wall of the intestine.
This process is called absorption. The
inner walls of the small intestine have
thousands of finger-like outgrowths.
These are called villi (singular villus).
Can you guess what the role of villi could
be in the intestine? The villi increase
the surface area for absorption of the
digested food. Each villus has a network
of thin and small blood vessels close to
its surface. The surface of the villi
absorbs the digested food materials. The
absorbed substances are transported
via the blood vessels to different organs
of the body where they are used to build
complex substances such as the
proteins required by the body. This is
called assimilation. In the cells, glucose
breaks down with the help of oxygen
into carbon dioxide and water, and
energy is released. The food that
remains undigested and unabsorbed
enters into the large intestine.
Large intestine
The large intestine is wider and shorter
than small intestine. It is about 1.5 metre
in length. Its function is to absorb  water
and some salts from the undigested food
material. The remaining waste passes
into the rectum and remains there as
semi-solid faeces. The faecal matter is
removed through the anus from
time-to-time. This is called egestion.
2.3 DIGESTION IN GRASS-EATING
ANIMALS
Have you observed cows, buffaloes
and other grass-eating animals
chewing continuously even when
they are not eating? Actually, they
quickly swallow the grass and store
it in a part of the stomach called
rumen (Fig. 2.9). Here the food gets

helps in digestion of cellulose. Many
animals, including humans, cannot
digest cellulose.
Animals like horses, rabbit, etc., have
a large sac-like structure called Caecum
between the oesophagus and the small
intestine (Fig. 2.9). The cellulose of the
food is digested here by the action of
certain bacteria which are not present in
humans.
So far you have learnt about animals
which possess the digestive system. But
there are many small organisms which do
not have a mouth and a digestive system.
Then, how do they acquire and digest
food? In the section below you will learn
another interesting way of food intake.
2.4 FEEDING AND DIGESTION IN
AMOEBA
Amoeba is a microscopic single-celled
organism found in pond water. Amoeba
has a cell membrane, a rounded, dense
nucleus and many small bubble-like
vacuoles (Fig. 2.10) in its cytoplasm.
Amoeba constantly changes its shape
and position. It pushes out one, or
more finger-like projections, called
pseudopodia or false feet for movement
and capture of food.
Paheli wants to know why
these animals cannot chew
food properly at the time they
take it in?
partially digested and is called cud.
But later the cud returns to the mouth
in small lumps and the animal chews
it. This process is called rumination and
these animals are called ruminants.
The grass is rich in cellulose, a type
of carbohydrate. In ruminants like cattle,
deer, etc., bacteria present in rumen

Amoeba feeds on some microscopic
organisms. When it senses food, it
pushes out pseudopodia around the
food particle and engulfs it. The food
becomes trapped in a food vacuole
[Fig. 2.10).
Digestive juices are secreted into the
food vacuole. They act on the food and
break it down into simpler substances.
Gradually the digested food is absorbed.
The absorbed substances are used for
growth, maintenance and multiplication.
The undigested residue of the food is
expelled outside by the vacuole.
The basic process of digestion of
food and release of energy is the same
in all animals. In a later chapter you
will learn about the transport of food
absorbed by the intestine to the various
parts of the body.


Digestion of carbohydrates, like starch, begins in the buccal cavity. The
digestion of protein starts in the stomach. The bile secreted from the
liver, the pancreatic juice from the pancreas and the digestive juice
from the intestinal wall complete the digestion of all components of food
in the small intestine. The digested food is absorbed in the blood vessels
from the small intestine.

The absorbed substances are transported to different parts of the body.
Water and some salts are absorbed from the undigested food in the
large intestine.

The undigested and unabsorbed residues are expelled out of the body
as faeces through the anus.

The grazing animals like cows, buffaloes and deer are known as
ruminants. They quickly ingest, swallow their leafy food and store it in
the rumen. Later, the food returns to the mouth and the animal chews it
peacefully.

Amoeba ingests its food with the help of its false feet or pseudopodia.
The food is digested in the food vacuole.
