ou know that woollen clothes are
made from animal fibres. You
also know that cotton clothes are
made from plant fibres. We wear woollen
clothes during winters when it is cold
outside. Woollen clothes keep us warm.
We prefer to wear light coloured cotton
clothes when it is hot. These give us a
feeling of coolness. You might have
wondered why particular types of
clothes are suitable for a particular
season.
In winter you feel cold inside the
house. If you come out in the sun, you
feel warm. In summer, you feel hot even
inside the house. How do we know
whether an object is hot or cold? How
do we find out how hot or cold an object
is? In this chapter we shall try to seek
answers to some of these questions.
3.1  HOT AND COLD
In our day-to-day life, we come across a
number of objects. Some of them are hot
We see that some objects are cold
while some are hot. You also know that
some objects are hotter than others
while some are colder than others.  How
do we decide which object is hotter than
the other? We often do it by touching
the objects. But is our sense of touch
reliable? Let us find out.

them as A, B and C. Put cold water in

you do not have a thermometer, request
a friend to share it with you. A clinical
thermometer looks like the one shown
in Fig. 3.2.
A clinical thermometer consists of a
long, narrow, uniform glass tube. It has
a bulb at one end. This bulb contains
mercury. Outside the bulb, a small
shining thread of mercury can be seen.
If you do not see the mercury thread,
rotate the thermometer a bit till you see
it.  You will also find a scale on the
thermometer. The scale we use is the
celsius scale, indicated by °C.
Boojho’s confusion shows that we
cannot always rely on our sense of touch
to decide whether an object
is hot or cold. Sometimes
it may deceive us.
Then, how do we find
out how hot an object really
is? A reliable measure of the
hotness of an object is its
temperature. Temperature is
measured by a device called
thermometer.
3.2 MEASURING TEMPERATURE
Have you seen a thermometer? Recall
that when you or someone else in your
family had fever, the temperature was
measured by a thermometer. The
thermometer that measures our body
temperature is called a clinical
thermometer. Hold the thermometer in

container C.  Now dip your left hand in
container A and the right hand in
container B. After keeping the hands in
the two containers for 2–3 minutes, put
both the hands simultaneously in
container C (Fig. 3.1).  Do both the
hands get the same feeling?
Boojho wondered which of the two scales
shown in Fig. 3.2 he should read.  Paheli told
him that India has adopted the celsius scale
and we should read that scale.  The other scale
with the range 94–108 degrees is the
Fahrenheit scale (°F). It was in use earlier.
Boojho says,“My left hand
tells me that the water in mug
C is hot and the right hand
tells me that the same water
is cold.  What should I
conclude?”

Precautions to be observed while using a clinical thermometer
Thermometer should be washed before and after use, preferably with an
antiseptic solution.
Ensure that before use the mercury level is below 35°C.
Read the thermometer keeping the level of mercury along the line of sight.
(See Fig. 3.3).
Handle the thermometer with care. If it hits against some hard object, it can
break.
Don’t hold the thermometer by the bulb while reading it.

observations as in Table 3.2.
Is the body temperature of every
person 37°C?
The temperature of every person may
not be 37°C.  It could be slightly higher
or slightly lower.  Actually, what we call
normal temperature is the average body
temperature of a large number of healthy
persons.
The clinical thermometer is designed
to measure the temperature of human
body only.  The temperature of human
body normally does not go below 35oC
or above 42oC. That is the reason
that this thermometer has the range
35oC to 42oC.
Different types of thermometers
are used for different purposes.
The maximum and minimum
temperatures of the previous
day, reported in weather
reports, are measured by a
thermometer

laboratory thermometer is
generally from –10°C to 110°C

3.4 TRANSFER OF HEAT
You might have observed that a frying
pan becomes hot when kept on a flame.
It is because the heat passes from the
flame to the utensil. When the pan is
removed from the fire, it slowly cools
down.  Why does it cool down?  The heat
is transferred from the pan to the
surroundings.  So you can understand
that in both cases, the heat flows from
a hotter object to a colder object. In fact,

that heat will not be
transferred if the temperature of
two objects is the same?”
transferred from the end nearest to the
flame to the other end?
The process by which heat is
transferred from the hotter end to the
colder end of an object is known as
conduction. In solids, generally, the

heat is transferred by the process of
conduction.
Do all substances conduct heat
easily?   You must have observed that
the metallic pan for cooking has a plastic
or wooden handle.  Can you lift a hot
pan by holding it from the handle
without getting hurt?
Activity 3.7
Heat water in a small pan or a beaker.
Collect some articles such as a steel
spoon, plastic scale, pencil and divider.
Dip one end of each of these articles in
hot water (Fig. 3.8). Wait for a few
minutes. Touch the other end. Enter
your observation in Table 3.3.
The materials which allow heat to
pass through them easily are
conductors of heat. For examples,
aluminum, iron and copper. The
materials which do not allow heat to
pass through them easily are poor
conductors of heat such as plastic and
wood. Poor conductors are known as
insulators.
The water and air are poor
conductors of heat. Then, how does the
heat transfer take place in these
substances?  Let us find out.
Activity 3.8
Take a round bottom flask (if flask is
not available, a beaker can be used).  Fill
it two-thirds with water. Place it on a
tripod, or make some arrangement to
place the flask in such a way that you
can heat it by placing a candle below it.
Wait till the water in the flask is
still. Place a crystal of potassium
permanganate at the bottom of the flask
gently using a straw. Now, heat the water
by placing the candle just below the
crystal.
Write your observation in your
notebook and also draw a picture of
what you observe (Fig. 3.9).

the water near the flame gets
hot.  Hot water rises up.

Notice that towards the top, the air
gets heated by convection. Therefore, the
hand above the flame feels hot. On the
sides, however, there is no convection
and air does not feel as hot as at
the top.
 The people living in the coastal areas
experience an interesting phenomenon.
During the day, the land gets heated
faster than the water. The air over the
land becomes hotter and rises up. The
cooler air from the sea rushes in towards
the land to take its place. The warm air
from the land moves towards the sea to
complete the cycle (Fig. 3.11). The air
from the sea is called the sea breeze. To
receive the cooler sea breeze, the windows
of the houses in coastal areas are made
to face the sea.  At night it is exactly the
reverse. The water cools down more
slowly than the land. So, the cool air
from the land moves towards the sea.
This is called the land breeze.
When we come out in the sun, we
feel warm. How does the heat from the
sun reach us? It cannot reach us by
conduction or convection as there is no
medium such as air in most part of the
space between the earth and the sun.
and water from the sides moves down.
This process continues till the whole
water gets heated. This mode of heat
transfer is known as convection.
How does the heat travel in air?  In
which direction does the smoke go?
The air near the heat source gets hot
and rises.  The air from the sides comes
in to take its place. In this way the air
gets heated. The following activity
confirms this idea.
Activity 3.9

flame and one hand on the side of the

From the sun the heat comes to us by
another process known as radiation.
The transfer of heat by radiation does
not require any medium. It can take
place whether a medium is present or
not. When we sit in front of a room
heater, we get heat by this process. A
hot utensil kept away from the flame
cools down as it transfers heat to the
surroundings by radiation. Our body
too, gives heat to the surroundings and
receives heat from it by radiation.
All hot bodies radiate heat.  When
this heat falls on some object, a part of
it is reflected, a part is absorbed and a
part may be transmitted. The
temperature of the object increases due
to the absorbed part of the heat. Why
are you advised to use an umbrella when
you go out in the sun?

which can is the water warmer?  You
can feel the difference even by touching
water in the two cans.
Activity 3.11
Fill the two cans used in Activity 3.10
with the same amount of hot water at
the same temperature (say, at 60oC).
Leave the cans in a room or in a shade.
Note the temperature of water after
10–15 minutes.  Does the temperature
of water in both the cans fall by the same
amount?
Do these activities suggest to you the
reason why it is more comfortable to
wear white or light-coloured clothes in
the summer and dark-coloured clothes
in the winter? Dark surfaces absorb
more heat and, therefore, we feel
comfortable with dark coloured clothes
in the winter. Light coloured clothes
reflect most of the heat that falls on them
and, therefore, we feel more comfortable
wearing them in the summer.
Woollen clothes keep us warm
in winter
In the winter, we use woollen clothes.
Wool is a poor conductor of heat.
Moreover, there is air trapped in between
the wool fibres. This air prevents the flow
of heat from our body to the cold
surroundings. So, we feel warm.
Suppose you are given the choice in
winter of using either one thick blanket
or two thin blankets joined together.
What would you choose and why?
Remember that there would be a layer
of air in between the blankets.

What you have learnt

Our sense of touch is not always a reliable guide to the degree of hotness
of an object.

Temperature is a measure of the degree of hotness of an object.

Thermometer is a device used for measuring temperature.

Clinical thermometer is used to measure our body temperature. The
range of this thermometer is from 35°C to 42°C.  For other purposes, we
use the laboratory thermometers. The range of these thermometers is
usually from –10°C to 110°C.

The normal temperature of the human body is 37°C.

The heat flows from a body at a higher temperature to a body at a lower
temperature. There are three ways in which heat can flow from one
object to another. These are conduction, convection and radiation.

In solids, generally, the heat is transferred by conduction. In liquids
and gases the heat is transferred by convection. No medium is required
for transfer of heat by radiation.

The materials which allow heat to pass through them easily are
conductors of heat.

The materials which do not allow heat to pass through them easily are
called insulators.

Dark-coloured objects absorb more heat than the light-coloured objects.
That is the reason we feel more comfortable in light-coloured clothes in
the summer.

Woollen clothes keep us warm during winter. It is so because wool is a
poor conductor of heat and it has air trapped in between the fibres.
