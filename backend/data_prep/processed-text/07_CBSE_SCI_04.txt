Acids, Bases and Salts
4
W
e use in our daily life a large
number of substances such
as lemon, tamarind, common
salt, sugar and vinegar. Do they have
the same taste? Let us recall tastes of
some edible substances listed in
Table 4.1. If you have not tasted any of
these substances taste it now and enter
the result in Table 4.1.
You find that some of these
substances taste sour, some taste bitter,
some taste sweet and some taste salty.
4.1 ACIDS AND BASES
Curd, lemon juice, orange juice and
vinegar taste sour. These substances
taste sour because they contain acids.
The chemical nature of such substances
is acidic. The word acid comes from the
Latin word acere which means sour.
The acids in these substances are
natural acids.
What about baking soda? Does it also
taste sour? If not, what is its taste? Since,
it does not taste sour it means, that it
has no acids in it. It is bitter in taste. If
you rub its solution between fingers, it
feels soapy. Generally, substances like
these which are bitter in taste and feel
soapy on touching are known as bases.
The nature of such substances is said to
be basic.
If we cannot taste every substance,
how do we find its nature?
Special type of substances are used
to test whether a substance is acidic or
basic. These substances are known as
indicators. The indicators change their
colour when added to a solution
containing an acidic or a basic
substance. Turmeric, litmus, China rose
petals (Gudhal), etc., are some of the
naturally occurring indicators.
CAUTION
1. Do not taste anything unless asked
to do so.
2. Do not touch anything unless asked
to do so.

4.2 NATURAL INDICATORS
AROUND US
Litmus: A natural dye
The most commonly used natural
indicator is litmus. It is extracted
from lichens (Fig. 4.1a). It has a
mauve (purple) colour in distilled
water. When added to an acidic
solution, it turns red and when
added to a basic solution, it turns
blue. It is available in the form of a
solution, or in the form of strips of
paper, known as litmus paper.
Generally, it is available as red and
blue litmus paper (Fig. 4.1b).
Can I taste all substances to
find their taste?
No. Have you not read the
caution? We should not
taste unknown
substances. They could
harm us.

Activity 4.2
Take a tablespoonful of turmeric
powder. Add a little water and make
a paste.
Make turmeric paper by depositing
turmeric paste on blotting paper/filter
paper and drying it. Cut thin strips
of the yellow paper obtained.
Put a drop of soap solution on the

Activity 4.1
Mix some water with lemon juice in a
plastic cup/tumbler/test tube.
Put a drop of the above solution on a
strip of the red litmus paper with the
help of a dropper.
Is there any change in colour?
Repeat the same exercise with the
blue litmus paper.
Note down if there is any change in
colour.
Perform the same activity with the
following substances:
Tap water, detergent solution, aerated
drink, soap solution, shampoo, common
salt solution, sugar solution, vinegar,
baking soda solution, milk of magnesia,
washing soda solution, lime water. If
possible make solutions in distilled water.
Record your observations as in
Table. 4.2.
In your Table, are there any
substances on which litmus had no
effect? Name those substances.
The solutions which do not change
the colour of either red or blue litmus
are known as neutral solutions. These
substances are neither acidic nor basic.
To prepare limewater, take some water in a tumbler and add some lime (chuna)
into it. Stir the solution and keep it for some time. Pour a little from the top.
This is lime water.

Stir the tube gently. Is there any change
in the colour of the solution? Continue
adding the sodium hydroxide solution
drop by drop while stirring till the pink
colour just appears.
Now add one more drop of dilute
hydrochloric acid. What do you observe?
The solution again becomes colourless.
Again add one drop of sodium
hydroxide solution. Is there any change
in colour? The solution again becomes
pink in colour.
It is evident that when the solution
is basic, phenolphthalein gives a pink
colour. On the other hand, when the
solution is acidic, it remains colourless.

Demonstrate the effect of the three
indicators on each of these solutions.
Record your observations in Table 4.5.
4.3 NEUTRALISATION
We have learnt that acids turn blue
litmus red and bases turn red litmus
blue. Let us see what happens when an
acid is mixed with a base.
We are going to use an indicator you
have not used so far. It is called
phenolphthalein.
Activity 4.5
To be demonstrated by the teacher in
the class
Fill one fourth of a test tube with dilute
hydrochloric acid. Note down its colour.
Note down the colour of phenolphthalein
solution also. Add 2–3 drops of the
indicator to the acid. Now shake the test
tube gently. Do you observe any change
in colour of the acid?
Add to the acidic solution a drop of
sodium hydroxide solution by a dropper.
Are you familiar with the term acid rain? Have you ever heard about damaging
effect of acid rain? As the name indicates the rain containing excess of acids is
called an acid rain. Where do these acids come from? The rain becomes acidic
because carbon dioxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide (which are released
into the air as pollutants) dissolve in rain drops to form carbonic acid, sulphuric
acid and nitric acid respectively. Acid rain can cause damage to buildings,
historical monuments, plants and animals.
CAUTION
Great care should be taken while
handling laboratory acids and bases
because these are corrosive in nature,
irritating and harmful to skin.

When an acidic solution is mixed
with a basic solution, both the solutions
neutralise the effect of each other. When
an acid solution and a base solution are
mixed in suitable amounts, both the
acidic nature of the acid and the basic
nature of the base are destroyed. The
resulting solution is neither acidic nor
basic. Touch the test tube immediately
after neutralisation. What do you
observe? In neutralisation reaction, heat
is always produced, or evolved. The
evolved heat raises the temperature of
the reaction mixture.
In neutralisation reaction a new
substance is formed. This is called salt.
Salt may be acidic, basic or neutral in
nature. Thus, neutralisation can be
defined as follows:
The reaction between an acid and
a base is known as neutralisation. Salt
and water are produced in this process
with the evolution of heat.
Acid+Base  Salt+Water
     (Heat is evolved)
The following reaction is an example:
Hydrochloric acid (HCl) + Sodium
hydroxide (NaOH) 
Sodium chloride (NaCl) + Water (H2O)
Boojho added dilute sulphuric acid
to lime water. Will the reaction mixture
become hot or cool?
4.4 NEUTRALISATION IN EVERYDAY
LIFE
Indigestion
Our stomach contains hydrochloric
acid. It helps us to digest food, as you
have learnt in Chapter 2. But too
much of acid in the stomach causes
indigestion. Sometimes indigestion
is painful. To relieve indigestion, we
take an antacid such as milk of
magnesia, which contains magnesium
hydroxide. It neutralises the effect of
excessive acid.
Ant bite
When an ant bites, it injects
the acidic liquid (formic acid) into the
skin. The effect of the acid can be
neutralised by rubbing moist baking
soda (sodium hydrogencarbonate) or
calamine solution, which contains zinc
carbonate.
Soil treatment
Excessive use of chemical fertilisers
makes the soil acidic. Plants do not
grow well when the soil is either too
acidic or too basic. When the soil is
too acidic, it is treated with bases like
quick lime (calcium oxide) or slaked
lime (calcium hydroxide). If the soil
is basic, organic matter (compost) is
added to it. Organic matter releases
acids which neutralises the basic
nature of the soil.
Factory wastes
The wastes of many factories
contain acids. If they are allowed to
flow into the water bodies, the acids
will kill fish and other organisms.
The factory wastes are, therefore,
neutralised 
by 
adding 
basic
substances.

Acids are sour in taste. Generally, bases are bitter in taste and soapy to
touch.

Acid turns blue litmus red. Bases turn red litmus blue.

Substances which are neither acidic nor basic are called neutral.

Solutions of substances that show different colour in acidic, basic and
neutral solutions are called indicators.
