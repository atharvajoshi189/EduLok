9.1  AREA OF A PARALLELOGRAM
We come across many shapes other than squares and rectangles.
How will you find the area of a land which is a parallelogram in shape?
Let us find a method to get the area of a parallelogram.
Can a parallelogram be converted into a rectangle of equal area?
Draw a parallelogram on a graph paper as shown in Fig 9.1(i). Cut out the
parallelogram. Draw a line from one vertex of the parallelogram perpendicular to the
opposite side [Fig 9.1(ii)]. Cut out the triangle. Move the triangle to the other side of the
parallelogram.

What shape do you get? You get a rectangle.
Is the area of the parallelogram equal to the area
of the rectangle formed?
Yes, area of the parallelogram = area of the
rectangle formed
What are the length and the breadth of the
rectangle?

We find that the length of the rectangle formed is equal to the base of the parallelogram
and the breadth of the rectangle is equal to the height of the parallelogram (Fig 9.2).
Now,
Area of parallelogram = Area of rectangle
= length × breadth = l × b
But the length l and breadth b of the  rectangle are exactly the
base b and the height h, respectively of the parallelogram.
Thus, the area of parallelogram = base × height = b × h.

Any side of a parallelogram can be chosen as base of the
parallelogram. The perpendicular dropped on that side from the opposite
vertex is known as height (altitude). In the parallelogram ABCD, DE is
perpendicular to AB.  Here AB is the
base and DE is the height of the
parallelogram.
In this parallelogram ABCD, BF is the
perpendicular to opposite side AD. Here AD is the
base and BF is the height.

9.2  AREA OF A TRIANGLE
A gardener wants to know the cost of covering the whole of a triangular
garden with grass.
In this case we need to know the area of the triangular region.
Let us find a method to get the area of a triangle.
Draw a scalene triangle on a piece of paper. Cut out the triangle.
Place this triangle on another piece of paper and cut out another
triangle of the same size.
So now you have two scalene triangles of the same size.
Are both the triangles congruent?
Superpose one triangle on the other so that they match.
You may have to rotate one of the two triangles.
Now place both the triangles such that a pair of corresponding
sides is joined as shown in Fig 9.5.
Is the figure thus formed a parallelogram?
Compare the area of each triangle to the area of the
parallelogram.
Compare the base and height of the triangles with the base
and height of the parallelogram.
You will find that the sum of the areas of both the triangles is
equal to the area of the parallelogram. The base and the height
of the triangle are the same as the base and the height of the
parallelogram, respectively.
Area of each triangle = 1

In the figure (Fig 9.6) all the triangles are on the base

What can you say about the height of each of the
triangles corresponding to the base AB?
Can we say all the triangles are equal in area? Yes.
Are the triangles congruent also? No.
We conclude that all the congruent triangles
are equal in area but the triangles equal in area
need not be congruent.
Consider the obtuse-angled triangle ABC of base 6 cm (Fig 9.7).
Its height AD which is perpendicular from the vertex A is outside the
triangle.
Can you find the area of the triangle?
EXAMPLE 1 One of the sides and the corresponding height of a
parallelogram are 4 cm and 3 cm respectively. Find the
area of the parallelogram (Fig 9.8).
SOLUTION Given that length of base (b) = 4 cm, height (h) = 3 cm
Area of the parallelogram = b × h
= 4 cm × 3 cm = 12 cm2
EXAMPLE 2Find the height ‘x’ if the area of the
parallelogram is 24 cm2 and the base is
4 cm.
SOLUTION  Area of parallelogram = b × h
Therefore,24 = 4 × x (Fig 9.9)

SOLUTION
(i)
Area of parallelogram = b × h

9.3.1  Circumference of a Circle
Tanya cut different cards, in curved shape from a cardboard. She wants to put lace around
to decorate these cards. What length of the lace does she require for each? (Fig 9.19)
(a)
(b)
(c)
Fig 9.19
You cannot measure the curves with the help of a ruler, as these figures are not “straight”.
What can you do?
Here is a way to find the length of lace required for shape in
Fig 9.19(a). Mark a point on the edge of the card and place the
card on the table. Mark the position of the point on the table also
(Fig 9. 20).
Now roll the circular card on the table along a straight line till
the marked point again touches the table. Measure the distance
along the line. This is the length of the lace required (Fig 9.21). It is also the distance along
the edge of the card from the marked point back to the marked point.
You can also find the distance by putting a string on the edge of the circular object and
taking all round it.
The distance around a circular region is known as its circumference.
Take a bottle cap, a bangle or any other circular object and find the circumference.
Now, can you find the distance covered by the athlete on the track by this method?
Still, it will be very difficult to find the distance around the track or any other circular
object by measuring through string. Moreover, the measurement will not be accurate.
So, we need some formula for this, as we have for rectilinear figures or shapes.
Let us see if there is any relationship between the diameter and the circumference of
the circles.
Consider the following table: Draw six circles of different radii and find their circumference
by using string. Also find the ratio of the circumference to the diameter.

What do you infer from the above table? Is this ratio approximately the same? Yes.
Can you say that the circumference of a circle is always more than three times its
diameter? Yes.
This ratio is a constant and is denoted by π (pi). Its approximate value is 22
7  or 3.14.
So, we can say that  C
d = π , where ‘C’ represents circumference of the circle and ‘d’
its diameter.
or
C = πd
We know that diameter (d) of a circle is twice the radius (r) i.e., d = 2r
So,
C = πd = π × 2r
or
  C = 2πr.

Circumference of the pipe = 2πr

Therefore, length of the tape needed to wrap once around the pipe is 62.8 cm.

What will be the cost of polishing a circular table-top of radius 2 m at the
rate of ` 10 per square metre?
Can you tell what we need to find in such cases, Area or Perimeter? In such cases
we need to find the area of the circular region. Let us find the area of a circle,
using graph paper.
Draw a circle of radius 4 cm on a graph paper (Fig 9.25). Find the area by counting
the number of squares enclosed.
As the edges are not straight, we get a rough estimate of the area of circle by this method.
There is another way of finding the area of a circle.

As done above if we divide the circle in 64 sectors, and arrange these sectors. It
gives nearly a rectangle (Fig 9.28).

What is the breadth of this rectangle? The breadth of this rectangle is the radius of the
circle, i.e., ‘r’.
As the whole circle is divided into 64 sectors and on each side we have 32 sectors, the
length of the rectangle is the length of the 32 sectors, which is half of the circumference.
