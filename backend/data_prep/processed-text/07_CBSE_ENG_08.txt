Two friends share their feelings about brave soldiers.
One of them shares her experience of visiting the
National War Memorial that has left a deep impact
on her. They exchange letters and share their feelings
of gratitude for the freedom they enjoy because of
the sacrifices made by the bravehearts of the country.
The memorial symbolises the patriotism of the Indian
soldiers. Which is this memorial?

for many centuries. Post-independence our
country has had to fight several wars to protect
its borders, territorial integrity, and its people.
This made me wonder, who were these brave
Indian people? They fought to protect our country
and sacrificed their lives so that we could lead
our lives in peace. What were their names? Where
did they come from? Does anyone remember
anything about them?
Last week I got the answers to some of my
questions during an educational trip to New Delhi
organised by our school. You may recall, I was
looking forward to this trip and our visit to many
places of historical and educational significance.
I learnt several new and interesting things, and I
am excited to share them with you.
Let me begin by asking you to guess the name
of the monument that I found most inspiring. Lets
see if you can guess? The construction of this
monument started in April 2018 and was
completed in February 2019. It was envisioned
and then inaugurated by India’s Prime Minister
Shri Narendra Modi in February 2019. In terms
of location and size, it is spread over 40 acres of
land near the iconic India Gate. But more
importantly, it is a tribute to some of the bravest
Indians. I’m sure you’ve guessed! It’s the ‘National
War Memorial’. Won’t you say, a long desired
aspiration was fullfilled?

Our visit to the National War Memorial began
with our teacher explaining that even after
independence, India has had to fight many wars
to protect itself, and the freedom and security we
enjoy today is because of the many brave men
and women who have served in the Indian Armed
Forces over decades. Sadly, she said, war always
takes its toll, and therefore, many brave soldiers
have had to sacrifice their lives for the country
even after our independence in 1947. This is what
makes monuments like the National War
Memorial extremely important so that we should
never forget the cost of freedom. We are aware,
always, of the pain and horrors of war. We learnt
that each brick of the memorial is called a tablet,
and it bears the names of soldiers who fought for
India and made the supreme sacrifice in different
wars from 1947 till date, including the Indo-China
conflict of 1962, the Indo-Pak Wars in 1965 &
1971 and the Kargil War in 1999. There are
29,000 tablets on which more than 26,000 names
of fallen soldiers have been etched.
It was heartening to know that our government
has recognised the sacrifice of brave soldiers. Our
teacher told us about the 21 bravehearts who
were awarded the Param Vir Chakra (PVC), India’s
highest wartime gallantry medal, for their service
to the nation. She also told us about Maha Vir
Chakra (MVC), Kirti Chakra (KC), Vir Chakra (VrC)
and Shaurya Chakra (SC).

Major Somnath Sharma was posthumously
awarded India’s first PVC, in the Battle of Badgam
in 1947. Later some more PVCs were awarded for
exceptional gallantry during the India-China
Conflict of 1962, and the India-Pakistan War of
1965. Besides, a PVC was also awarded for service
during the U.N.Peace Keeping Operations in Congo.
In the 1971 war, some of the heroes who were
awarded the PVC (posthumously) includes Lance
Naik Albert Ekka, Flying Officer Nirmal Jit Singh
Sekhon, Second Lieutenant Arun Khetarpal  and
Major Hoshiar Singh. Some Navy personnel
including Captain Mahendra Nath Mulla were also
awarded MVC for their exemplary courage and
leadership.
Then the teacher shared with us the citation
of Param Vir Chakra awardee Lance Naik Albert
Ekka. It touched my heart and also motivated
me. We were awestruck and humbled by his
bravery. I aspire to be courageous like him when
I join the army!

 Lance Naik Albert Ekka,
(No. 4239746), 14 Guards
Lance Naik Albert Ekka was in the left forward
company of a Battalion of the Brigade of Guards
during their attack on the enemy defence at
Gangasagar on the eastern front. This was a
well-fortified position held in strength by the
enemy. The assaulting troops were subjected
to intense shelling and heavy small arms fire,
but they charged on to the objective and were
locked in bitter hand-to-hand combat. Lance
Naik Albert Ekka noticed an enemy Light
Machine Gun inflicting heavy casualties on his
company. With complete disregard to his
personal safety, he charged the enemy bunker,
bayoneted two enemy soldiers and silenced the
Light Machine Gun. Though seriously wounded
in this encounter, he continued to fight
alongside his comrades through the mile deep
objective, clearing bunker after bunker with
undaunted courage. Towards the northern end
of the objective, one enemy Medium Machine
Gun opened up from the second storey of a
well-fortified building inflicting heavy casualties
and holding up the attack. Once again, this
gallant soldier without worrying about his
personal safety, despite his serious injury and
the heavy volume of enemy fire, crawled forward

till he reached the building and lobbed a grenade
through the loophole of the bunker, killing one
enemy and injuring the other. The Medium
Machine Gun, however, continued to fire. With
outstanding courage and grim determination,
Lance Naik Albert Ekka scaled a side wall and
entering the bunker, bayoneted the enemy who
was still firing and thus silenced the Machine
Gun, saving further casualties to his company
and ensured the success of the attack. In this
process, however, he received serious injuries
and succumbed to them after the capture of the
objective. In this action, Lance Naik Albert Ekka
displayed the most conspicuous valour,
determination and made the supreme sacrifice
in the best traditions of the Army. (Gazette of
India, Notification No. 7– Pres./72)
As we continued our visit around the National
War Memorial, we came across another important
installation called Amar Jawan Jyoti that
commemorates our soldiers. The name, as you
may have guessed, represents an immortal flame
that is kept ablaze all through the day and night
to revere the sacrifices of our soldiers. Earlier the
Amar Jawan Jyoti which also displayed a rifle
and a helmet was alighted under the arch of India
Gate in January 1972 to commemorate India’s
victory in the India-Pakistan War of 1971.
The National War Memorial now includes
Amar Jawan Jyoti in the obelisk which is

surrounded by four chakras. During the
inauguration, the Prime Minister lit a new flame
to commemorate the fallen heroes. Later, the old
flame at India Gate was also merged with the new
flame at the  National War Memorial. Here is a
picture of the new Amar Jawan Jyoti if you haven’t
seen it. You can see the obelisk surrounded by
wreaths that have been placed as a mark of
respect. The lighting design is planned in such a
way that it transforms the monument’s landscape
as sunlight changes from dawn to dusk. It truly
is a majestic site that filled me with pride for our
nation. I was also overwhelmed by the
interminable flame as a metaphor for eternal
stories of courage and valour.

Our teacher also explained the significance of
the Chakras to us. I found it interesting and hence
sharing with you.
The National War Memorial consists of 4
concentric circles which are known as Amar
Chakra, Veerta Chakra, Tyag Chakra and Raksha
Chakra around a 15-meter-tall central obelisk
with the eternal flame— the Amar Jawan Jyoti. It
also houses bronze and stone murals and graphic
panels. Isn’t it amazing!
The innermost circle represents the Amar
Chakra, also known as the ‘Circle of Immortality’.
This has the Obelisk with Eternal Flame. The
Amar Jawan Jyoti flame symbolises the
immortality of the spirit of fallen soldiers with the
assurance that the nation will never forget their
sacrifice.
The second circle is called the Veerta Chakra
which is also known as the ‘Circle of Bravery’.
There is a covered gallery that exhibits six murals
crafted in bronze depicting valiant battle actions
of our Armed Forces.
The third circle represents the Tyag Chakra,
also known as the ‘Circle of Sacrifice’. The circular
concentric walls of honour symbolise the ancient
war formation which is called Chakravyuh. The
walls are covered with granite tablets and
individual tablet is solely dedicated to each fallen
hero of post-Independent India. Their names are
etched in golden letters.
The outermost circle represents the Raksha
Chakra, which is also known as the ‘Circle of

Protection’. In this chakra the row of trees is a
reassurance to the citizens of the country about
their safety against any threat. Each tree
represents the soldiers who ensure the territorial
integrity of the nation.
We spent the whole day, from morning to
evening, at the National War Memorial and the
surrounding areas, marked by majestic lawns
and grand buildings of Kartavyapath. We were
immersed in the ambience that was solemn and
a reminder of what a free nation could achieve.
The overall environment created an emotive
experience that was visually inspiring. I felt as
if I had developed bond with the place.
I learnt a lot. But I also have to admit that the
various discourses on the day brought tears to

my eyes. It was sad to think about the massive
devastation and loss of life caused by wars. It
motivated me to live a life worthy of the sacrifices
of our heroes.
After our visit, the class decided to make
presentations on stories of valour of the brave
hearts, we came across at the National War
Memorial. We divided ourselves into five groups.
We are choosing martyrs to make presentations
depicting their courageous stories. Our teacher
has also advised us to share our experience
during the school assembly. I am delighted that
all the students of our school will get to know
about the National War Memorial and the soldiers
it commemorates.
I am going to give a presentation on the story
of Major Padmapani Acharya who fought for India
in the 1999 Kargil War and was awarded the Maha
Vir Chakra.

Operation: Op Vijay- Kargil
Date of Award: 15 Aug 1999
CITATION
MAJOR PADMAPANI ACHARYA (IC-55072)
2 RAJPUTANA RIFLES
(POSTHUMOUS)
On 28 June 1999, Major Padmapani Acharya
as a Company Commander, was assigned the
formidable task of capturing an enemy position
which was heavily fortified, strongly held and
covered with mines and sweeping machine gun
and artillery fire.
Success of the battalion and brigade
operation hinged on the early capture of this
position. However, the company attack almost
faltered at the very beginning when the enemy’s
artillery fire came down squarely on the leading
platoon, inflicting large number of casualties.
With utter disregard to his personal safety,
Major Padmapani Acharya took the reserve
platoon of his company and led it through raining
artillery shells. Even as his men were falling to
the murderous enemy fire, he continued to
encourage his men and charged at the enemy
up the steep rock face with his reserve platoon.
2024-25


A HOMAGE TO OUR BRAVE SOLDIERS/125
Unmindful of the hail of bullets from the
enemy’s position, Major Padmapani Acharya
crawled up to the enemy position and lobbed
grenades. In this daring assault, Major Acharya
was severely injured. Despite being seriously
injured and unable to move, he ordered his men
to leave him and charge at the enemy while he
continued to fire at the enemy. The enemy
position was finally over-run and the objective
was captured.
After completion of the mission, the officer
however, succumbed to his injuries.
Major Padmapani Acharya displayed
exceptional courage, leadership and spirit of
self-sacrifice in the face of the enemy.

If you fight, you will either be slain on the battlefield and go

O, son of  Kunti, and be prepared to fight.
Before he went into battle, he wrote a letter to his
father that he wasn’t afraid or scared about losing
his life while trying to protect the motherland.
Quoting Shrimad Bhagavad Gita, he went on to say:

Date: 24 April 2022
Dear Soumya,
It was such a pleasure to receive your letter. I
enjoyed reading your experience of the visit to the
National War Memorial in Delhi, as well as your
observations and feelings during the visit. You
really have an eye for detail and being the sensitive
person that you are, you have been able to capture
the essence of the emotions associated with this
Memorial.
I was happy to hear that you got an opportunity
to visit the National War Memorial. I have heard a
lot about it. Some people might see a war
memorial as just a  monument, statue, an edifice
to celebrate a war or victory and commemorate
those who were martyred or injured in war. In my
view, it is also an expression of deep gratitude for
the supreme sacrifice made by our brave soldiers
defending the sovereignty and integrity of the
country. I feel motivated and I am seriously
thinking of joining the Armed Forces for serving
my motherland.
I also feel it is our duty to periodically visit
such places to honour our valiant soldiers, who

have made great sacrifices for us. Their sacrifices
enable us to walk freely in our country without
fear of enemy threats. It is nice of your teacher
and school to arrange this visit to give you all a
chance to learn about India’s heroes and also
pay your respect to them. The idea of your class
to make a presentation at the school and making
every one a part of your experience is wonderful!
Best of luck for your presentation, I hope it goes
well and motivates the school students to join
the Indian Armed Forces.
Your letter has reminded me of a time when
we visited the war memorial in our city. If I
remember correctly, the day was National Martyrs
Day. While visiting one of Chandigarh’s gardens
we saw a lot of activity around the Bougainvillea
Garden in Sector 3. As we approached the garden,
we saw people offering flowers and prayers. We
joined the group out of curiosity and quickly
realised that they were all there to pay respect to
the soldiers at the War Memorial.
When I think back about my visit where
everyone was dedicating flowers as a mark of
respect to our soldiers, I was reminded of the
following poem:

stories of courage, bravery, and sacrifice which
remind us that many of the  challenges we face in
our lives are inconsequential. We can enjoy peace
in our country and the luxury of exchanging ideas
with our friends because our Armed Forces are
alert and work hard to create that environment
for us.
Very recently I read in the newspaper that
Captain Anuj Nayyar, MVC, an Indian Army
officer of the 17 Jat regiment was posthumously
awarded the Maha Vir Chakra, India’s second
highest gallantry award, for exemplary valour
during the Kargil War in 1999. I look forward to
learning more about him.  Meanwhile, I learnt
that his mother Meena Nayyar has written a
memoir titled Tiger of Drass– Capt. Anuj Nayyar
– 23 – Kargil Hero which I shall certainly go
through. I am sharing with you an excerpt of her
interview with IANS.

It is truly said:
I have shared your experience with many of

‘National War Memorial and Museum’. This app
is very interactive and provides answers to our
queries in 21 languages. The murals on the walls
are enchanting. A great learning experience
indeed!

Next week, I am going to share this idea with
my classmates and my teacher. I think it would be
great to create a collage capturing the lives and
stories of people that can inspire us each day.
I know that we can email each other. I really
like to receive letters from you, not just because
of the ideas that you share but also because the
envelope of your letters often comes with beautiful
stamps, that make me happy. I don’t know if I
ever shared it before, but collecting stamps is one
of my favourite hobbies. I’ve been doing it for
years. But I learnt recently that the act of collecting
stamps is called ‘philately’. This time I received a
stamp that celebrates India’s independence, a
theme related to your letter.
Okay, that’s all from me for now. But before I
conclude, guess what we had for breakfast!—
fluffy idlies and we all remembered you. Give my
regards to your parents.
I am inspired by your letter!

A HOMAGE TO OUR BRAVE SOLDIERS/137
Meadow Surprises
Walk across a green field, a park or even under a clump
of trees, and you will notice many wonderful things.
What are some of the surprises a meadow has for
someone with a keen eye and a sharp ear?
Meadows have surprises,
You can find them if you look;
Walk softly through the velvet grass,
And listen by the brook.
You may see a butterfly
Rest upon a buttercup
And unfold its drinking straws
To sip the nectar up.
You may scare a rabbit
Who is sitting very still;
Though at first you may not see him,
When he hops you will.
A dandelion whose fuzzy head
Was golden days ago
Has turned to airy parachutes
That flutter when you blow.

Explore the meadow houses,
The burrows in the ground,
A nest beneath tall grasses,
The ant’s amazing mound.
Oh! Meadows have surprises
And many things to tell;
You may discover these yourself,
If you look and listen well.

Delivery Delayed
Answer
The postman started moving
round the tree in circles. The dog
followed him, but as he did so, his
leash got wrapped around the tree.
The postman then safely walked
up to the front door.
Read the following poem about the world of nature, which  is
as busy as the world of human beings.
Busy World
Bees are buzzing, frogs are hopping,
Moles are digging.  There’s no stopping
Vines from climbing, grass from growing,
Birds from singing, winds from blowing,
Buds from blooming. Bees are humming,
Sunbeams dancing, raindrops drumming.
All the world is whirling, dizzy,
Summertime is very busy!
