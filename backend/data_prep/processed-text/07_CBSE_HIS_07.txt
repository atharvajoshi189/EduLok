THE MAKING OF 
REGIONAL CULTURES
O
ne of the commonest ways of describing people 
is in terms of the language they speak. When we 
refer to a person as a Tamil or an Oriya, this usually 
means that he or she speaks Tamil or Oriya and lives 
in Tamil Nadu or Orissa. We also tend to associate 
each region with distinctive kinds of food, clothes, 
poetry, dance, music and painting. Sometimes we take 
these identities for granted and assume that they have 
existed from time immemorial. However, the frontiers 
separating regions have evolved over time (and in 
fact are still changing). Also, what we understand 
as regional cultures today are often the product of 
complex processes of intermixing of local traditions 
with ideas from other parts of the subcontinent. As 
regions, others seem to be similar across regions, and 
yet others derive from older practices in a particular 
area, but take a new form in other regions. 
The Cheras and the Development               
of Malayalam 
Let us begin by looking at an example of the 
connection between language and region. The Chera 
kingdom of Mahodayapuram was established in 
the ninth century in the south-western part of the 
peninsula, part of the present-day Kerala. It is likely 
that Malayalam was spoken in this area. The rulers 
introduced the Malayalam language and script in their 
inscriptions. In fact, this is one of the earliest examples 
 
the subcontinent.

At the same time, the Cheras also drew upon 
Sanskritic traditions. The temple theatre of Kerala, 
which is traced to this period, borrowed stories 
Malayalam, dated to about the twelfth century, are 
directly indebted to Sanskrit.  Interestingly enough, a 
fourteenth-century text, the 
dealing with 
grammar and poetics, was composed in Manipravalam 
– literally, “diamonds and corals” referring to the two 
languages, Sanskrit and the regional language.   
Rulers and Religious Traditions:              
The Jagannatha Cult
In other regions, regional cultures grew around 
religious traditions. The best example of this 
process is the cult of Jagannatha (literally, lord of 
the world, a name for Vishnu) at Puri, Orissa. To 
date, the local tribal people make 
the wooden image of the deity, which 
suggests that the deity was originally 
with Vishnu.
In the twelfth century, one of the 
most important rulers of the Ganga 
dynasty, Anantavarman, decided 
to erect a temple for Purushottama 
Jagannatha at Puri. Subsequently, in 
1230, king Anangabhima III dedicated 
his kingdom to the deity and proclaimed 
himself as the “deputy” of the god.

THE MAKING OF  
REGIONAL CULTURES
As the temple gained in 
importance as a centre of 
pilgrimage, its authority in 
social and political matters 
also increased. All those who 
conquered Orissa, such as 
the Mughals, the Marathas 
and the English East India 
Company, attempted to gain 
control over the temple. They felt 
that this would make their rule 
acceptable to the local people.  
The Rajputs and 
Traditions of Heroism
In the nineteenth century, the 
region that constitutes most 
of present-day Rajasthan, 
was called Rajputana by the British. While this may 
suggest that this was an area that was inhabited 
only or mainly by Rajputs, this is only partly true. 
There were (and are) several groups who identify 
themselves as Rajputs in many areas of northern 
and central India. And of course, there are several 
peoples other than Rajputs who live in 
Rajasthan. However, the Rajputs are often 
recognised as contributing to the distinctive 
culture of Rajasthan. 
These cultural traditions were closely linked 
with the ideals and aspirations of rulers. 
From about the eighth century, most of the 
present-day state of Rajasthan was ruled by 
various Rajput families. Prithviraj (Chapter 2) 
was one such ruler. These rulers cherished 
the ideal of the hero who fought valiantly, 
than face defeat. Stories about Rajput heroes 
were recorded in poems and songs, which 
were recited by specially trained minstrels.

These preserved the memories of heroes and were 
expected to inspire others to follow their example. 
Ordinary people were also attracted by these stories 
– which often depicted dramatic situations, and a 
range of strong emotions – loyalty, friendship, love, 
valour, anger, etc. 
Did women find a place within these stories? 
Sometimes women are depicted as following their 
heroic husbands in both life and death – there are 
stories about the practice of 
or the immolation 
of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands. So 
those who followed the heroic ideal often had to pay 
for it with their lives.

Beyond Regional Frontiers:               
The Story of Kathak 
If heroic traditions can be found in different regions in 
different forms, the same is true of dance. Let us look at 
the history of one dance form, Kathak now associated 
with several parts of north India. The term 
 
is derived from 
, a word used in Sanskrit and 
other languages for story. The 
 were originally 
a caste of story-tellers in temples of north India, who 
embellished their performances with gestures and 
songs. Kathak began evolving into a distinct mode of 
the spread of the bhakti movement. The legends of 
Radha-Krishna were enacted in folk plays called r
, which combined folk dance with the basic gestures 
of the 
 story-tellers.
Under the Mughal emperors and their nobles, Kathak 
was performed in the court, where it acquired its present 
features and developed into a form of dance with a 
distinctive style. Subsequently, it developed in two 
traditions or 
: one in the courts of Rajasthan 
(Jaipur) and the other in Lucknow Under the patronage 
of Wajid Ali Shah, the last Nawab of Awadh, it grew into 
a major art form. By the third quarter of the nineteenth 
only in these two regions, but in the adjoining areas of 
present-day Punjab, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir,

Bihar and Madhya Pradesh. Emphasis was laid on 
intricate and rapid footwork, elaborate costumes, as 
well as on the enactment of stories. 
Kathak, like several other cultural practices, was 
viewed with disfavour by most British administrators 
in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. However, it 
survived and continued to be performed by courtesans, 
and was recognised as one of the six “classical” forms 
of dance in the country after independence.

“Classical” dances
The question of defining any art form as “classical” 
is often quite complicated. Do we define something 
as classical if it deals with a religious theme? Or do 
we consider it classical because it appears to require 
a great deal of skill acquired through long years of 
training? Or is it classical because it is performed 
according to rules that are laid down, and variations 
are not encouraged? These are questions we need to 
think about. It is worth remembering that many dance 
forms that are classified as “folk” also share several 
of the characteristics considered 
typical of “classical” forms. So, 
while the use of the term 
“classical” may suggest 
that these forms are 
superior, this need not 
always be literally true. 
Other dance forms 
that are recognised as 
classical at present are:

Painting for Patrons: The Tradition            
of Miniatures
Another tradition that developed in different ways was 
that of miniature painting. Miniatures (as their very 
name suggests) are small-sized paintings, generally 
done in water colour on cloth or paper. The earliest 
miniatures were on palm leaves or wood. Some of the 
most beautiful of these, found in western India, were 
used to illustrate Jaina texts. The Mughal emperors 
Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan patronised highly 
skilled painters who primarily illustrated manuscripts 
containing historical accounts and poetry. These were 
generally painted in brilliant colours and portrayed 
court scenes, scenes of battle or hunting, and other 
aspects of social life. They were often 
exchanged as gifts and were viewed 
only by an exclusive few – the emperor 
and his close associates.
With the decline of the Mughal 
Empire, many painters moved 
out to the courts of the emerging 
regional states (see also Chapter 8). 
As a result Mughal artistic tastes 
influenced the regional courts of 
the Deccan and the Rajput courts 
of Rajasthan. At the same time, 
they retained and developed their 
distinctive characteristics. Portraits 
of rulers and court scenes came to 
be painted, following the Mughal 
example. Besides, themes from 
mythology and poetry were depicted 
at centres such as Mewar, Jodhpur, 
Bundi, Kota and Kishangarh. 
Another region that attracted 
miniature paintings was the 
Himalayan foothills around the 
modern-day state of Himachal 
Pradesh. By the late seventeenth

century, this region had developed a bold and intense 
style of miniature painting called Basohli. The most 
popular text to be painted here was Bhanudatta’s 
. Nadir Shah’s invasion and the conquest 
of Delhi in 1739 resulted in the migration of Mughal 
artists to the hills to escape the uncertainties of the 
plains. Here they found ready patrons which led to 
the founding of the Kangra school of painting. By the 
mid-eighteenth century the Kangra artists developed 
a style which breathed a new spirit into miniature 
painting. The source 
of inspiration was the 
Vaishnavite traditions. 
Soft colours including 
cool blues and greens, 
and a lyrical treatment 
of themes distinguished

A Closer Look:  Bengal 
The Growth of a Regional Language
As we saw at the outset, we often tend to identify regions 
in terms of the language spoken by the people. So, we 
assume that people in Bengal always spoke Bengali. 
However, what is interesting is that while Bengali is 
now recognised as a language derived from Sanskrit, 
BCE) suggest 
that the people of Bengal did not speak Sanskritic 
languages. How, then, did the new language emerge? 
From the fourth-third centuries BCE, commercial ties 
began to develop between Bengal and Magadha (south 
of Sanskrit. During the fourth century, the Gupta 
rulers established political control over north Bengal 
and began to settle Brahmanas in this area. Thus, the 
valley became stronger. In the seventh century, the 
Chinese traveller Xuan Zang observed that languages 
related to Sanskrit were in use all over Bengal. 
From the eighth century, Bengal became the centre 
of a regional kingdom under the Palas (Chapter 2). 
Between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries, 
Bengal was ruled by Sultans who were independent of 
the rulers in Delhi (Chapter 3). In 1586, when Akbar

conquered Bengal, it formed the nucleus of the Bengal

Bengali developed as a regional language. 
of dialects came to be united by a common literary 
language based on the spoken language of the western 
part of the region, now known as West Bengal. 
Thus, although Bengali is derived from Sanskrit, it 
passed through several stages of evolution. Also, a 
wide range of non-Sanskrit words, derived from a 
variety of sources including tribal languages, Persian, 
and European languages, have become a part of 
modern Bengali. 
Early Bengali literature may be divided into two 
categories – one indebted to Sanskrit and the other 
Sanskrit epics, the Mangalakavyas (literally auspicious 
poems, dealing with local deities) and bhakti literature, 
such as the biographies of Chaitanyadeva, the leader 
of the Vaishnava bhakti movement (Chapter 6). 
The second includes Nath literature, such as 
the songs of Maynamati and Gopichandra, stories 
concerning the worship of Dharma Thakur, and fairy 
tales, folk tales and ballads. 
Maynamati, Gopichandra and                  
Dharma Thakur 
The Naths were ascetics who engaged in a variety of 
yogic practices. 
This particular song, which was often enacted, 
described how Maynamati, a queen, encouraged her 
son Gopichandra to adopt the path of asceticism in the 
face of a variety of obstacles. 
Dharma Thakur is a popular regional deity, often 
worshipped in the form of a stone or a piece of wood.

belonging to the second category circulated orally 
and cannot be precisely dated. They were particularly 
Brahmanas was relatively weak.
Pirs and Temples
From the sixteenth century, people began to migrate 
in large numbers from the less fertile western Bengal 
to the forested and marshy areas of south-eastern 
Bengal. As they moved eastwards, they cleared 
forests and brought the land under rice cultivation. 
Gradually, local communities of fisherfolk and 
shifting cultivators, often tribals, merged with the 
new communities of peasants. 
This coincided with the establishment of Mughal 
control over Bengal with their capital in the heart of 
received land and often set up mosques that served 
as centres for religious transformation in these areas. 
The early settlers sought some order and assurance 
in the unstable conditions of the new settlements. 
These were provided by community leaders, who also 
functioned as teachers and adjudicators and were 
sometimes ascribed with supernatural powers. People 
referred to them with affection and respect as
.
This term included saints or Sufis and other 
soldiers, various Hindu and Buddhist deities and even 
animistic spirits. The cult of 
 became very popular 
and their shrines can be found everywhere in Bengal. 
Bengal also witnessed a temple-building spree 
the nineteenth century. We have seen (Chapter 2) 
that temples and other religious structures were often 
built by individuals or groups who were becoming 
powerful – to both demonstrate their power and 
proclaim their piety. Many of the modest brick 


90
and terracotta temples in Bengal were built with the 
support of several “low” social groups, such as the 
Kolu (oil pressers) and the Kansari (bell metal workers). 
The coming of the European trading companies created 
new economic opportunities; many families belonging 
to these social groups availed of these. As their social 
and economic position improved, they proclaimed 
their status through the construction of temples. 
When local deities, once worshipped in thatched huts 
in villages, gained the recognition of the Brahmanas, 
their images began to be housed in temples. The 
temples began to copy the double-roofed (
) or 
four-roofed (
) structure of the thatched huts. 
This led to the evolution of the typical Bengali style in 
temple architecture. 
In the comparatively more complex four-roofed 
structure, four triangular roofs placed on the four 
walls move up to converge on a curved line or a point. 
Temples were usually built on a square platform. The 
interior was relatively plain, but the outer walls of many 
temples were decorated with paintings, ornamental 
tiles or terracotta tablets. In some temples, particularly 
in Vishnupur in the Bankura district of West Bengal, 
such decorations reached a high degree of excellence.

temple shown 
here with that in
