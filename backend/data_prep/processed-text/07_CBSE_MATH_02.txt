2.1  MULTIPLICATION OF FRACTIONS
You know how to find the area of a rectangle. It is equal to length × breadth. If the length
and breadth of a rectangle are 7 cm and 4 cm respectively, then what will be its area? Its
area would be 7 × 4 = 28 cm2.
What will be the area of the rectangle if its length and breadth are 7 1
2  cm and
3 1
2  cm respectively? You will say it will be 7 1
2  × 3 1
2  = 15
2  × 7
2  cm2. The numbers 15

and 7
2  are fractions. To calculate the area of the given rectangle, we need to know how to
multiply fractions. We shall learn that now.
2.1.1  Multiplication of a Fraction by a Whole Number

Fraction as an operator ‘of’
Observe these figures (Fig 2.6)
The two squares are exactly similar.
Each shaded portion represents 1
2  of 1.
So, both the shaded portions together will represent 1
2  of 2.
Combine the 2 shaded 1
2  parts. It represents 1.
So, we say 1
2  of 2 is 1. We can also get it as 1
2  × 2 = 1.
Thus, 1

Also, look at these similar squares (Fig 2.7).

folding the part once. What will one of the pieces represent? It will represent 1

Let us now see how to find the product of two fractions like 1
2

.
To do this we first learn to find the products like 1
2  × 1
3 .
(a) How do we find  1
3 of a whole? We divide the whole in three equal parts. Each of
the three parts represents 1
3 of the whole. Take one part of these three parts, and
shade it as shown in Fig 2.8.
(b) How will you find 1
2 of this shaded part? Divide this one-third (1
3 ) shaded part into
two equal parts. Each of these two parts represents 1
2  of  1
3  i.e., 1
2  × 1
3 (Fig 2.9).
        Take out 1 part of these two and name it ‘A’. ‘A’ represents 1
2  × 1
3 .
(c) What fraction is ‘A’ of the whole? For this, divide each of the remaining 1
3  parts also
in two equal parts. How many such equal parts do you have now?
There are six such equal parts. ‘A’ is one of these parts.
So, ‘A’ is 1
6  of the whole. Thus,  1
2  × 1
3   =  1
6 .
How did we decide that ‘A’ was 1
6  of the whole? The whole was divided in 6 = 2 × 3
parts and 1 = 1 × 1 part was taken out of it.
Thus,
1
2  × 1
3  = 1
6   = 1×1
2×3
or

This is also shown by the figures drawn below. Each of these five equal shapes

two equal parts. One part out of it is the shape we considered. What will it represent?
It will represent 1

So, we are required to divide a whole number by a fraction or a fraction by another
fraction. Let us see how to do that.
2.2.1  Division of Whole Number by a Fraction
Let us find 1÷ 1
2 .
We divide a whole into a number of equal parts such that each part is half of the whole.
The number of such half ( 1
2 ) parts would be 1÷ 1
2 . Observe the figure (Fig 2.11). How
many half parts do you see?
There are two half parts.
So,
1 ÷ 1
2  = 2. Also, 
2
1 1
×
 = 1 × 2 = 2.
Thus, 1 ÷ 1
2  = 1 × 2

Similarly, 3 ÷ 1
4  = number of 1
4 parts obtained when each of the 3 whole, are divided

2.3  MULTIPLICATION OF DECIMAL NUMBERS
Reshma purchased 1.5kg vegetable at the rate of ` 8.50 per kg. How much money should
she pay? Certainly it would be ` (8.50 × 1.50). Both 8.5 and 1.5 are decimal numbers.
So, we have come across a situation where we need to know how to multiply two deci-
mals. Let us now learn the multiplication of two decimal numbers.
First we find 0.1 × 0.1.
Now, 0.1 = 1
10 . So, 0.1 × 0.1 = 1
1
×
10
10  =
1×1
10×10  = 1
100  = 0.01.
Let us see it’s pictorial representation (Fig 2.13)
The fraction 1
10  represents 1 part out of 10 equal
parts.
Fig 2.13
2024-25


FRACTIONS AND DECIMALS

The shaded part in the picture represents 1
10 .
We know that,
1
1
×
10
10  means 1
10  of 1
10 . So, divide this 1
10
th part into 10 equal parts and take one
part out of it.
Thus, we have, (Fig 2.14).
        
Fig 2.14
The dotted square is one part out of 10 of the 1
10
th part. That is, it represents
1
1
×
10
10  or  0.1 × 0.1.
Can the dotted square be represented in some other way?
How many small squares do you find in Fig 2.14?
There are 100 small squares. So the dotted square represents one out of 100 or 0.01.
Hence, 0.1 × 0.1 = 0.01.
Note that 0.1 occurs two times in the product. In 0.1 there is
one digit to the right of the decimal point. In 0.01 there are two
digits (i.e., 1 + 1) to the right of the decimal point.
Let us now find 0.2 × 0.3.
We have, 0.2 × 0.3 = 2
3
×
10
10
As we did for 1
1
10
10

, let us divide the square into 10 equal
parts and take three parts out of it, to get 3
10 . Again divide each

MATHEMATICS

TRY THESE
of these three equal parts into 10 equal parts and take two from each. We get 2
3
×
10
10 .
The dotted squares represent 2
3
×
10
10  or 0.2 × 0.3. (Fig 2.15)
Since there are 6 dotted squares out of 100, so they also reprsent 0.06.
Thus, 0.2 × 0.3 = 0.06.
Observe that 2 × 3 = 6 and the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in 0.06
is 2 (= 1 + 1).
Check whether this applies to 0.1 × 0.1 also.
Find 0.2 × 0.4 by applying these observations.
While finding 0.1 × 0.1 and 0.2 × 0.3, you might have noticed that first we multiplied
them as whole numbers ignoring the decimal point. In 0.1 × 0.1, we found 01 × 01 or 1 ×
1. Similarly in 0.2 × 0.3 we found 02 × 03 or 2 × 3.
Then, we counted the number of digits starting from the rightmost digit and moved
towards left. We then put the decimal point there. The number of digits to be counted is
obtained by adding the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in the decimal
numbers that are being multiplied.
Let us now find 1.2 × 2.5.
Multiply 12 and 25. We get 300. Both, in 1.2 and 2.5, there is 1 digit to the right of the
decimal point. So, count 1 + 1 = 2 digits from the rightmost digit (i.e., 0) in 300 and move
towards left. We get 3.00 or 3.
Find in a similar way 1.5 × 1.6, 2.4 × 4.2.
While multiplying 2.5 and 1.25, you will first multiply 25 and 125. For placing the
decimal in the product obtained, you will count 1 + 2 = 3 (Why?) digits starting from the
rightmost digit. Thus, 2.5 × 1.25 = 3.225
Find 2.7 × 1.35.
   1. Find:
(i) 2.7 × 4
(ii) 1.8 × 1.2
(iii) 2.3 × 4.35
   2. Arrange the products obtained in (1) in descending order.
EXAMPLE 3
The side of an equilateral triangle is 3.5 cm. Find its perimeter.
SOLUTION
All the sides of an equilateral triangle are equal.

So, length of each side = 3.5 cm
Thus, perimeter = 3 × 3.5 cm = 10.5 cm
EXAMPLE 4
The length of a rectangle is 7.1 cm and its breadth is 2.5 cm.
What is the area of the rectangle?
SOLUTION
Length of the rectangle = 7.1 cm
Breadth of the rectangle = 2.5 cm
Therefore, area of the rectangle = 7.1 × 2.5 cm2 = 17.75 cm2
2.3.1 Multiplication of Decimal Numbers by 10, 100 and 1000
Reshma observed that 2.3 = 23
10  whereas 2.35 = 235
100 . Thus, she found that depending
on the position of the decimal point the decimal number can be converted to a fraction with
denominator 10 or 100. She wondered what would happen if a decimal number is multiplied
by 10 or 100 or 1000.
Let us see if we can find a pattern of multiplying numbers by 10 or 100 or 1000.
Have a look at the table given below and fill in the blanks:
1.76 × 10  = 176
100 × 10 = 17.6
2.35 ×10 =___
12.356 × 10 =___
1.76 × 100 = 176
100 × 100 = 176 or 176.0 2.35 ×100 = ___
12.356 × 100 =___
1.76 × 1000 = 176
100  × 1000 = 1760   or
2.35 ×1000 = ___
12.356 × 1000 = ___
                                                1760.0
0.5 × 10 = 5
10  × 10 = 5     ;     0.5 × 100 = ___     ;     0.5 × 1000 = ___
Observe the shift of the decimal point of the products in the table. Here the numbers are
multiplied by 10,100 and 1000. In 1.76 × 10 = 17.6, the digits are same i.e., 1, 7 and 6. Do
you observe this in other products also? Observe 1.76 and 17.6. To which side has the
decimal point shifted, right or left? The decimal point has shifted to the right by one place.
Note that 10 has one zero over 1.
In 1.76×100 = 176.0, observe 1.76 and 176.0. To which side and by how many
digits has the decimal point shifted? The decimal point has shifted to the right by two
places.
Note that 100 has two zeros over one.
Do you observe similar shifting of decimal point in other products also?
2024-25


MATHEMATICS
38
So we say, when a decimal number is multiplied by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits in
the product are same as in the decimal number but the decimal point in the product
is shifted to the right by as, many of places as there are zeros over one.
Based on these observations we can now say
0.07 × 10 = 0.7, 0.07 × 100 = 7 and 0.07 × 1000 = 70.
Can you now tell 2.97 × 10 = ?    2.97 × 100 = ?    2.97 × 1000 = ?
Can you now help Reshma to find the total amount i.e., ` 8.50 ×

2.4  DIVISION OF DECIMAL NUMBERS
Savita was preparing a design to decorate her classroom. She needed a few coloured
strips of paper of length 1.9 cm each. She had a strip of coloured paper of length 9.5 cm.
How many pieces of the required length will she get out of this strip? She thought it would
be 9.5
1.9
cm. Is she correct?
Both 9.5 and 1.9 are decimal numbers. So we need to know the division of
decimal numbers too!
2.4.1  Division by 10, 100 and 1000

Let us see if we can find a pattern for dividing numbers by 10, 100 or 1000. This may
help us in dividing numbers by 10, 100 or 1000 in a shorter way.
31.5 ÷ 10 = 3.15
231.5 ÷ 10 =___
1.5 ÷ 10 =___

31.5 ÷ 1000 = 0.0315 231.5 ÷ 1000 =___
1.5 ÷ 1000 =___
29.36 ÷ 1000 =___
Take 31.5 ÷ 10 = 3.15. In 31.5 and 3.15, the digits are
same i.e., 3, 1, and 5 but the decimal point has shifted in the
quotient. To which side and by how many digits? The decimal
point has shifted to the left by one place. Note that 10 has one
zero over 1.
Consider now 31.5 ÷ 100 = 0.315. In 31.5 and 0.315 the
digits are same, but what about the decimal point in the quotient?
It has shifted to the left by two places. Note that 100 has two
zeros over1.
So we can say that, while dividing a number by 10, 100 or 1000, the digits of the
number and the quotient are same but the decimal point in the quotient shifts to the
left by as many places as there are zeros over 1. Using this observation let us now
quickly find:        2.38 ÷ 10 = 0.238,  2.38 ÷ 100 = 0.0238, 2.38 ÷ 1000 = 0.00238
2.4.2  Division of a Decimal Number by a Whole Number

right. We get 3.2 again.
To find 19.5 ÷ 5, first find 195 ÷5. We get 39. There is one digit to the
right of the decimal point in 19.5. Place the decimal point in 39 such that there
would be one digit to its right. You will get 3.9.

the decimal in 12.96. Making similar placement of the decimal in 324, you
will get 3.24.
Note that here and in the next section, we have considered only those divisions in
which, ignoring the decimal, the number would be completely divisible by another number
to give remainder zero. Like, in 19.5 ÷ 5, the number 195 when divided by 5, leaves
remainder zero.
However, there are situations in which the number may not be completely divisible by
another number, i.e., we may not get remainder zero. For example, 195 ÷ 7. We deal with
such situations in later classes.

decimal in 0.5. This could be converted to whole number by dividing by 10. Accordingly
25.5 was also converted to a fraction by dividing by 10.
Or, we say the decimal point was shifted by one place to the right in 0.5 to make it 5.
So, there was a shift of one decimal point to the right in 25.5 also to make it 255.

Each side of a regular polygon is 2.5 cm in length. The perimeter of the
polygon is 12.5cm. How many sides does the polygon have?
SOLUTION
The perimeter of a regular polygon is the sum of the lengths of all its
equal sides = 12.5 cm.
Length of each side = 2.5 cm. Thus, the number of sides = 12.5
2.5  = 125
25  = 5
The polygon has 5 sides.
EXAMPLE 7
A car covers a distance of 89.1 km in 2.2 hours. What is the average

Distance covered by the car = 89.1 km.

So distance covered by it in 1 hour    = 89.1
2.2  = 891

4. A reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by inverting it upside down.
5. We have seen how to divide two fractions.
(a) While dividing a whole number by a fraction, we multiply the whole number
with the reciprocal of that fraction.
For example, 
3
5
10
2
2×

(b) While dividing a fraction by a whole number we multiply the fraction by the
reciprocal of the whole number.
For example, 2

(c) While dividing one fraction by another fraction, we multuiply the first fraction by
the reciprocal of the other. So, 2

6. We also learnt how to multiply two decimal numbers. While multiplying two decimal
numbers, first multiply them as whole numbers. Count the number of digits to the right
of the decimal point in both the decimal numbers. Add the number of digits counted.
Put the decimal point in the product by counting the digits from its rightmost place.
The count should be the sum obtained earlier.
For example, 0.5 × 0.7 = 0.35

7. To multiply a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, we move the decimal point in the
number to the right by as many places as there are zeros over 1.
Thus  0.53 × 10 = 5.3,     0.53 × 100 = 53,      0.53 × 1000 = 530
8. We have seen how to divide decimal numbers.
(a) To divide a decimal number by a whole number, we first divide them as whole
numbers. Then place the decimal point in the quotient as in the decimal number.
For example, 8.4 ÷ 4 = 2.1
Note that here we consider only those divisions in which the remainder is zero.
(b) To divide a decimal number by 10, 100 or 1000, shift the digits in the decimal
number to the left by as many places as there are zeros over 1, to get the
quotient.
So, 23.9 ÷ 10 = 2.39,23.9 ÷ 100 = 0 .239, 23.9 ÷ 1000 = 0.0239
(c) While dividing two decimal numbers, first shift the decimal point to the right by
equal number of places in both, to convert the divisor to a whole number. Then
divide. Thus, 2.4 ÷ 0.2 = 24 ÷ 2 = 12.
