THE MUGHALS
R
uling as large a territory as the Indian subcontinent 
 with such a diversity of people and cultures was an 
the Middle Ages. Quite in contrast to their predecessors, 
the Mughals created an empire and accomplished what 
had hitherto seemed possible for only short periods 
of time. From the latter half of the sixteenth century, 
they expanded their kingdom from Agra and Delhi, 
until in the seventeenth century they controlled nearly 
all of the subcontinent. They imposed structures of 
administration and ideas of governance that outlasted 
their rule, leaving a political legacy that succeeding 
rulers of the subcontinent could not ignore. Today 
the Prime Minister of India addresses the nation on 
Independence Day from the ramparts of the Red Fort 
in Delhi, the residence of the Mughal emperors.

Who were the Mughals?
The Mughals were descendants 
of two great lineages of rulers. 
From their mother’s side they were 
descendants of Genghis Khan (died 
1227), the Mongol ruler who ruled 
over parts of China and Central 
Asia. From their father’s side, they 
were the successors of Timur (died 
1404), the ruler of Iran, Iraq and 
modern-day Turkey. However, 
the Mughals did not like to be 
called Mughal or Mongol. This was 
because Genghis Khan’s memory 
was associated with the massacre 
of innumerable people. It was also 
linked with the Uzbegs, their Mongol 
competitors. On the other hand, the 
Mughals were proud of their Timurid 
ancestry, not least of all because 
their great ancestor had captured

he was only 12 years old. He 
was forced to leave his ancestral 
throne due to the invasion of 
another Mongol group, the Uzbegs. 
After years of wandering, he

THE MUGHALS
Mughal Traditions of Succession 
The Mughals did not believe in the rule of primogeniture, 
where the eldest son inherited his father’s estate. 
Instead they followed the Mughal and Timurid 
custom of coparcenary inheritance, or a division of 
the inheritance amongst all the sons. Which do you 
think is a fairer division of inheritance: primogeniture 
or coparcenary?
Mughal Relations with Other Rulers
The Mughal rulers campaigned constantly against 
rulers who refused to accept their authority. But as 
the Mughals became powerful many other rulers 
also joined them voluntarily. The Rajputs are a good 
example of this. Many of them married their daughters 
into Mughal families and received high positions. But 
many resisted as well. 
Mughal marriages 
with the Rajputs 
The mother of 
Jahangir was                   
a Kachhwaha 
princess, daughter 
of the Rajput 
ruler of Amber 
(modern- day 
Jaipur). The 
mother of Shah 
Jahan was a Rathor 
princess, daughter 
of the Rajput 
ruler of Marwar 
(Jodhpur).

Mansabdars and Jagirdars
As the empire expanded to encompass different 
regions, the Mughals recruited diverse bodies of 
people. From a small nucleus of Turkish nobles 
(Turanis) they expanded to include Iranians, Indian 
Muslims, Afghans, Rajputs, Marathas and other 
groups. Those who joined Mughal service were

In Akbar’s reign, these

so that their revenues were 
roughly equal to the salary 
of the

Aurangzeb’s reign, this was 
no longer the case and the 
actual revenue collected was 
often less than the granted

increase in the number of

As a result, many 
 tried to extract as much 
revenue as possible while they had a

was unable to control these developments in the 
last years of his reign and the peasantry therefore 
suffered tremendously. 
Zabt and Zamindars 
The main source of income available to Mughal 
rulers was tax on the produce of the peasantry. In 
most places, peasants paid taxes through the rural 
elites, that is, the headman or the local chieftain. The 
Mughals used one term – zamindars – to describe all 
intermediaries, whether they were local headmen 
of villages or powerful chieftains.
Akbar’s revenue minister, Todar Mal, carried 
out a careful survey of crop yields, prices 
and areas cultivated for a 10-year period, 
was divided into revenue circles with its own 
schedule of revenue rates for individual crops. 
This revenue system was known as 
. It 
was prevalent in those areas where Mughal 
administrators could survey the land and keep 
very careful accounts. This was not possible in 
provinces, such as Gujarat and Bengal.

In some areas, the zamindars exercised a great deal 
of power. The exploitation by Mughal administrators 
and peasants of the same caste allied in rebelling 
against Mughal authority. These peasant revolts 
challenged the stability of the Mughal Empire from 
the end of the seventeenth century.

Mehrunnisa married the Emperor Jahangir 
in 1611 and received the title Nur Jahan. She 
remained extremely loyal and supportive 
to the monarch. As a mark of honour, 
Jahangir struck silver coins bearing his 
own titles on one side and on the other 
the inscription “struck in the name of the 
Queen Begum, Nur Jahan”. 
The adjoining document is an order 
(farman) of Nur Jahan. The square seal 
states, “Command of her most Sublime and 
Elevated Majesty Nur Jahan Padshah Begum”. 
The round seal states, “by the sun of Shah 
Jahangir she became as brilliant as the moon; may Nur 
Jahan Padshah be the lady of the age”.

 Akbar Nama and Ain-i Akbari
Akbar ordered one of his close friends and 
courtiers, Abul Fazl, to write a history of 
his reign. Abul Fazl wrote a three-volume 
history of Akbar’s reign, titled Akbar 
Nama. The first volume dealt with Akbar’s 
ancestors and the second volume recorded 
the events of Akbar’s reign. The third 
volume is the Ain-i Akbari. It deals with 
Akbar’s administration, household, army, 
the revenues and the geography of his 
empire. It also provides rich details about 
the traditions and culture of the people 
living in India. The most interesting aspect 
about the Ain-i Akbari is its rich statistical 
details about things as diverse as crops, 
yields, prices, wages and revenues.

Sulh-i kul
Jahangir, Akbar’s son, described his father’s policy of 
sulh-i kul in the following words: 
As in the wide expanse of the divine compassion there is room 
for all classes and the followers of all creeds, so … in his 
Imperial dominions, which on all sides were limited only by 
the sea, there was room for the professors of opposite religions, 
and for beliefs, good and bad, and the road to intolerance was 
closed. Sunnis and Shias met in one mosque and Christians 
and Jews in one church to pray. He consistently followed the 
principle of “universal peace” (sulh-i kul).
The Mughal Empire in the Seventeenth 
Century and After
The administrative and military efficiency of the 
Mughal Empire led to great economic and commercial 
prosperity. International travellers described it as the 
fabled land of wealth. But these same visitors were 
also appalled at the state of poverty that existed side 
by side with the greatest opulence. The inequalities 
were glaring. Documents from the twentieth year of

who supplied them with goods and produce. But the 
scale of revenue collection left very little for investment 
in the hands of the primary producers – the peasant 
and the artisan. The poorest amongst them lived 
from hand to mouth and they could hardly consider 
investing in additional resources – tools and supplies –

to increase productivity. The wealthier peasantry and 
in this economic world.
The enormous wealth and resources commanded 
by the Mughal elite made them an extremely powerful 
group of people in the late seventeenth century. As the 
authority of the Mughal emperor slowly declined, his 
servants emerged as powerful centres of power in the 
regions. They constituted new dynasties and held the 
command of provinces like Hyderabad and Awadh. 
Although they continued to recognise the Mughal 
emperor in Delhi as their master, by the eighteenth 
century the provinces of the empire had consolidated 
their independent political identities.
