RATIONAL NUMBERS  1
1.1  Introduction
In Mathematics, we frequently come across simple equations to be solved. For example,
the equation
x + 2 = 13
(1)
is solved when x = 11, because this value of x satisfies the given equation. The  solution
11 is a natural number. On the other hand, for the equation
x + 5 = 5
(2)
the solution gives the whole number 0 (zero). If we consider only natural numbers,
equation (2) cannot be solved. To solve equations like (2), we added the number zero to
the collection of natural numbers and obtained the whole numbers. Even whole numbers
will not be sufficient to solve equations of type
x + 18 = 5
(3)
Do you see ‘why’? We require the number –13 which is not a whole number. This
led us to think of integers, (positive and negative). Note that the positive integers
correspond to natural numbers. One may think that we have enough numbers to solve all
simple equations with the available list of integers. Now consider the equations
2x  = 3
(4)
5x + 7 = 0
(5)
for which we cannot find a solution from the integers. (Check this)
We need the numbers 
3
2  to solve equation (4) and 
7
5
−
 to solve
equation (5). This leads us to the collection of rational numbers.
We have already seen basic operations on rational
numbers. We now try to explore some properties of operations
on the different types of numbers seen so far.

In general, if a and b are any two
whole numbers, their product ab
is a whole number.
Division

8 , which is  not a
whole number.
Check for closure property under all the four operations for natural numbers.
(ii) Integers
Let us now recall the operations under which integers are closed.

– 6 – (– 8) = 2, an integer
Is 8 – (– 6) an integer?
In general, for any two integers
a and b, a – b is again an integer.
Check if b – a is also an integer.
Multiplication

Integers are closed under

– 5 × (– 8) = 40, an integer

under division.
You have seen that whole numbers are closed under addition and multiplication but
not under subtraction and division. However, integers are closed under addition, subtraction
and multiplication but not under division.
(iii) Rational numbers
Recall that a number which can be written in the form p
q , where p and q are integers
and q ≠ 0 is called a rational number. For example, 
2
3
−
, 6
7 , 9
5
− are all rational
numbers. Since the numbers 0, –2, 4 can be written in the form p
q , they are also
rational numbers. (Check it!)

for a few more pairs of rational numbers.
We say that rational numbers are closed under addition. That is, for any
two rational numbers a and b, a + b is also a rational number.
(b) Will the difference of two rational numbers be again a rational number?

Can you say that rational numbers are closed under division?
We find that for any rational number a, a ÷ 0 is not defined.
So rational numbers are not closed under division.
However, if we exclude zero then the collection of, all other rational numbers is
closed under division.

THINK, DISCUSS AND WRITE
You have done such additions earlier also. Do a few more such additions.
What do you observe? You will find that when you add 0 to a whole number, the sum
is again that whole number. This happens for integers and rational numbers also.
In general,
a + 0 = 0 + a = a,
where a is a whole number
b + 0 = 0 + b = b,
where b is an integer
c + 0 = 0 + c = c,
where c is a rational number
Zero is called the identity for the addition of rational numbers. It is the additive
identity for integers and whole numbers as well.

What do you find?
You will find that when you multiply any rational number with 1, you get back the same
rational number as the product. Check this for a few more rational numbers. You will find
that, a × 1 = 1 × a = a for any rational number a.
We say that 1 is the multiplicative identity for rational numbers.
Is 1 the multiplicative identity for integers? For whole numbers?
If a property holds for rational numbers, will it also hold for integers? For whole
numbers? Which will? Which will not?

RATIONAL NUMBERS  13
1. Rational numbers are closed under the operations of addition, subtraction and multiplication.
2. The operations addition and multiplication are
(i) commutative for rational numbers.
(ii) associative for rational numbers.
3. The rational number 0 is the additive identity for rational numbers.
4. The rational number 1 is the multiplicative identity for rational numbers.
5. Distributivity  of rational numbers: For all rational numbers a, b and c,
a(b + c) = ab + ac    and      a(b – c) = ab – ac
6. Between any two given rational numbers there are countless rational numbers. The idea of mean
helps us to find rational numbers between two rational numbers.
