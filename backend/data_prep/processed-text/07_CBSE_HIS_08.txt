POLITICAL FORMATIONS

f you look at Maps 1 and 2 closely, you will see 
something significant happening in the subcontinent 
during the first half of the eighteenth century. Notice 
how the boundaries of the Mughal Empire were 
reshaped by the emergence of a number of independent

kingdoms. By 1765, 
notice how another 
power, the British, had 
successfully grabbed 
major chunks of territory 
in eastern India. What 
these maps tell us is 
that political conditions 
in eighteenth-century 
India changed quite 
dramatically and within 
a relatively short span 
of time. 
In this chapter, we 
will read about the 
emergence of new 
political groups in the 
subcontinent during 
the first half of the 
eighteenth century – 
roughly from 1707, 
when Aurangzeb died, 
till the third battle of 
Panipat in 1761.
The Crisis of the Empire and  
the Later Mughals
In Chapter 4, you saw how the Mughal Empire reached 
the height of its success and started facing a variety 
of crises towards the closing years of the seventeenth 
century. These were caused by a number of factors. 
Emperor Aurangzeb had depleted the military and 
financial resources of his empire by fighting a long 
war in the Deccan. 
Under his successors, the efficiency of the imperial 
administration broke down. It became increasingly 
difficult for the later Mughal emperors to keep a check 
on their powerful mansabdars. Nobles appointed 
as governors (subadars) often controlled the offices 
?

group of people 
challenged Mughal 
authority for the 
longest time in 
Aurangzeb’s reign?

of revenue and military administration (diwani and 
faujdari) as well. This gave them extraordinary political, 
economic and military powers over vast regions of the 
Mughal Empire. As the governors consolidated their 
control over the provinces, the periodic remission of 
revenue to the capital declined.
Peasant and zamindari rebellions in many parts of 
northern and western India added to these problems. 
These revolts were sometimes caused by the pressures 
of mounting taxes. At other times they were attempts 
by powerful chieftains to consolidate their own 
positions. Mughal authority had been challenged by 
rebellious groups in the past as well. But these groups 
were now able to seize the economic resources of the 
region to consolidate their positions. The Mughal 
emperors after Aurangzeb were unable to arrest the 
gradual shifting of political and economic authority 
into the hands of provincial governors, local chieftains 
and other groups. 
Rich harvests and empty coffers 
The following is a contemporary writer’s account of the 
financial bankruptcy of the empire: 
The great lords are helpless and impoverished. Their peasants 
raise two crops a year, but their lords see nothing of either, and 
their agents on the spot are virtual prisoners in the peasants’ 
hands, like a peasant kept in his creditor’s house until he 
can pay his debt. So complete is the collapse of all order and 
administration that though the peasant reaps a harvest of 
gold, his lord does not see so much as a wisp of straw. How 
then can the lord keep the armed force he should? How can 
he pay the soldiers who should go before him when he goes 
out, or the horsemen who should ride behind him?

In the midst of this economic and political crisis, the 
ruler of Iran, Nadir Shah, sacked and plundered the 
city of Delhi in 1739 and took away immense amounts 
of wealth. This invasion was followed by a series of 
plundering raids by the Afghan ruler Ahmad Shah 
Abdali, who invaded north India five times between 
1748 and 1761.
Nadir Shah attacks Delhi
The devastation of Delhi after Nadir Shah’s invasion was 
described by contemporary observers. One described 
the wealth looted from the Mughal treasury as follows: 
sixty lakhs of rupees and some thousand gold coins, nearly one 
crore worth of gold-ware, nearly fifty crores worth of jewels, 
most of them unrivalled in the world, and the above included 
the Peacock throne.
 Another account described the invasion’s impact 
upon Delhi: 
(those) … who had been masters were now in dire straits; 
and those who had been revered couldn’t even (get water 
to) quench their thirst. The recluses were pulled out of their 
corners. The wealthy were turned into beggars. Those who 
once set the style in clothes now went naked; and those 
who owned property were now homeless … The New City 
(Shahjahanabad) was turned into rubble. (Nadir Shah) then 
attacked the Old quarters of the city and destroyed a whole 
world that existed there …

Shah.
Already under severe pressure from all sides, the 
empire was further weakened by competition amongst 
different groups of nobles. They were divided into 
two major groups or factions, the Iranis and Turanis 
(nobles of Turkish descent). For a long time, the later 
Mughal emperors were puppets in the hands of either

one or the other of these two powerful groups. 
The worst possible humiliation came when two 
Mughal emperors, Farrukh Siyar (1713 –1719) 
and Alamgir II (1754 –1759) were assassinated, 
and two others, Ahmad Shah (1748 –1754) and 
Shah Alam II (1759 –1816) were blinded by 
their nobles.
With the decline in the authority of the 
Mughal emperors, the governors of large 
provinces, subadars, and the great zamindars 
consolidated their authority in different parts 
of the subcontinent, such as Awadh, Bengal 
and Hyderabad. 
The Rajputs 
Many Rajput kings, particularly those belonging to 
Amber and Jodhpur, had served under the Mughals 
with distinction. In exchange, they were permitted to 
enjoy considerable autonomy in their watan jagirs. In 
the eighteenth century, these rulers now attempted to 
extend their control over adjacent regions. Ajit Singh, 
the ruler of Jodhpur, was also involved in the factional 
politics at the Mughal court. 
These influential Rajput families claimed the 
subadari of the rich provinces of Gujarat and Malwa. 
Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur held the governorship of 
Gujarat and Sawai Raja Jai Singh of Amber was the 
governor of Malwa. These offices were renewed by 
Emperor Jahandar Shah in 1713. They also tried to 
extend their territories by seizing portions of imperial 
territories neighbouring their watans. Nagaur was 
conquered and annexed to the house of Jodhpur, 
while Amber seized large portions of Bundi. Sawai 
Raja Jai Singh founded his new capital at Jaipur 
and was given the subadari of Agra in 1722. Maratha 
campaigns into Rajasthan from the 1740s put severe 
pressure on these principalities and checked their 
further expansion.

He possessed a large army, artillery and great wealth. His 
sway extended from Delhi to the banks of the Narmada.
Many Rajput chieftains built a 
number of forts on hill tops which 
became the centres of power. 
With extensive fortifications, 
these majestic structures 
housed urban centres, palaces, 
temples, trading centres, water 
harvesting structures and other 
buildings. The Chittorgarh fort 
contained many water bodies varying from talabs (ponds) 
to kundis (wells), baolis (stepwells), etc.

Seizing Independence
The Sikhs
The organisation of the Sikhs into a political community 
during the seventeenth century (see Chapter 6) helped 
in regional state-building in the Punjab. Several battles 
were fought by Guru Gobind Singh against the Rajput 
and Mughal rulers, both before and after the institution 
of the Khalsa in 1699. After his death in 1708, the Khalsa 
rose in revolt against the Mughal authority under Banda 
Bahadur’s leadership, declared their sovereign rule by 
striking coins in the name of Guru Nanak and Guru 
Gobind Singh, and established their own administration 
between the Sutlej and the Jamuna. Banda Bahadur 
was captured in 1715 and executed in 1716.

century, the Sikhs organised themselves into a 
number of bands called jathas, and later on misls. 
Their combined forces were known as the grand 
army (dal khalsa). The entire body used to meet 
at Amritsar at the time of Baisakhi and Diwali to 
take collective decisions known as “resolutions of 
the Guru (gurmatas)”. A system called rakhi was 
introduced, offering protection to cultivators on the 
payment of a tax of 20 per cent of the produce. 
Guru Gobind Singh had inspired the Khalsa with 
the belief that their destiny was to rule (raj karega 
khalsa). Their well-knit organisation enabled them 
to put up a successful resistance to the Mughal 
governors first and then to Ahmad Shah Abdali who 
had seized the rich province of the Punjab and the 
Sarkar of Sirhind from the Mughals. The Khalsa 
declared their sovereign rule by striking their own 
coin again in 1765. Significantly, this coin bore the 
same inscription as the one on the orders issued by 
the Khalsa in the time of Banda Bahadur.  
The Sikh territories in the late eighteenth century 
extended from the Indus to the Jamuna but they 
were divided under different rulers. One of them, 
Maharaja Ranjit Singh, reunited these groups and 
established his capital at Lahore in 1799.  
The Marathas
The Maratha kingdom was established by Chhatrapati 
Shivaji Maharaj (1630). The Maratha kingdom was 
another powerful regional kingdom to arise out 
of a sustained opposition to Mughal rule. Shivaji 
(1630–1680) carved out a stable kingdom with the 
support of powerful warrior families (deshmukhs). 
Groups of highly mobile, peasant-pastoralists 
(kunbis) provided the backbone of the Maratha 
army. Shivaji used these forces to challenge the 
Mughals in the peninsula. After Shivaji’s death, 
effective power in the Maratha state was wielded by a 
family of Chitpavan Brahmanas who served Shivaji’s 
successors as Peshwa (or principal minister). Poona 
became the capital of the Maratha kingdom.
Fig. 7
Portrait of Shivaji
Towards the end of the 
17th century,  
a powerful state 
started emerging in 
the Deccan under the 
leadership of Shivaji 
which finally led to the 
establishment of the 
Maratha state. Shivaji 
was born to Shahji and 
Jija Bai at Shivneri 
in 1630.  Under the 
guidance of his mother 
and his guardian 
Dada Konddev, Shivaji 
embarked on a career 
of conquest at a young 
age. The occupation 
of Javli made him the 
undisputed leader of 
the Mavala highlands 
which paved the way 
for further expansion. 
His exploits against 
the forces of Bijapur 
and the Mughals 
made him a legendary 
figure. He often 
resorted to guerrilla 
warfare against 
his opponents. By 
introducing an efficient 
administrative system 
supported by a revenue 
collection method 
based on chauth and 
sardeshmukhi, he laid 
the foundations of a 
strong Maratha state.

Under the Peshwas, the Marathas developed a very 
successful military organisation. Their success lay 
in bypassing the fortified areas of the Mughals, by 
raiding cities and by engaging Mughal armies in areas 
where their supply lines and reinforcements could be 
easily disturbed. 
Between 1720 and 1761, the Maratha empire 
expanded. It gradually chipped away at the authority 
of the Mughal Empire. Malwa and Gujarat were seized 
from the Mughals by the 1720s. By the 1730s, the 
Maratha king was recognised as the overlord of the 
entire Deccan peninsula. He possessed the right to 
levy chauth and sardeshmukhi in the entire region. 
After raiding Delhi in 1737, the frontiers of Maratha 
domination expanded rapidly: into Rajasthan and the 
Punjab in the north; into Bengal and Orissa in the 
east; and into Karnataka and the Tamil and Telugu 
countries in the South (see Map 1). These were not 
formally included in the Maratha empire, but were 
made to pay tribute as a way of accepting Maratha 
sovereignty. Expansion brought enormous resources, 
but it came at a price. These military campaigns also 
made other rulers hostile towards the Marathas. As a 
result, they were not inclined to support the Marathas 
during the third battle of Panipat in 1761.
Alongside endless military campaigns, the Marathas 
developed an effective administrative system as well. 
Once conquest had been completed and Maratha rule 
was secure, revenue demands were gradually introduced 
taking local conditions into account. Agriculture was 
encouraged and trade revived. This allowed Maratha 
chiefs (sardars) like Sindhia of Gwalior, Gaekwad of 
Baroda and Bhonsle of Nagpur the resources to raise 
powerful armies. Maratha campaigns into Malwa in 
the 1720s did not challenge the growth and prosperity 
of the cities in the region. Ujjain expanded under 
Sindhia’s patronage and Indore under Holkar’s. By 
all accounts, these cities were large and prosperous 
and functioned as important commercial and cultural 
centres. New trade routes emerged within the areas 
controlled by the Marathas. The silk produced in the 
Chanderi region now found a new outlet in Poona, 
the Maratha capital. Burhanpur which had earlier

expanded its hinterland to include Poona and Nagpur 
in the South and Lucknow and Allahabad in the East.
The Jats
Like the other states, the Jats consolidated their power 
during the late seventeenth and eighteenth-centuries. 
Under their leader, Churaman, they acquired control 
over territories situated to the west of the city of Delhi, 
and by the 1680s, they had begun dominating the 
region between the two imperial cities of Delhi and 
Agra. For a while, they became the virtual custodians 
of the city of Agra.  
The Jats were prosperous agriculturists, and towns 
like Panipat and Ballabhgarh became important 
trading centres in the areas dominated by them. Under 
Suraj Mal the kingdom of Bharatpur emerged as a 
strong state. When Nadir Shah sacked Delhi in 1739, 
many of the city’s notables took refuge there. His son 
Jawahir Shah had 30,000 troops of his own and hired 
another 20,000 Maratha and 15,000 Sikh troops to 
fight the Mughals.
While the Bharatpur fort was built in a fairly 
traditional style, at Dig the Jats built an elaborate 
garden palace combining styles seen at Amber and Agra. 
Its buildings were modelled on architectural forms first 
associated with royalty under Shah Jahan.
