When you think of water, what images come to your
mind? You think of rivers, the waterfalls, the pitter patter
of raindrops, water in your taps... Children love to float
paper boats in rain puddles. By noon the puddles vanish.
Where does the water go?
The sun’s heat causes evaporation of water into
vapour. When the water vapour cools down, it condenses
and forms clouds. From there it may fall on the land or
sea in the form of rain, snow or sleet.
The process by which water continually changes its
form and circulates between oceans,
atmosphere and land is known
as the water cycle (Fig 5.1).
Our earth is like a
terrarium. The same water
that existed centuries ago
still exists today. The
water used to irrigate a
field in Haryana may
have flowed down the
Amazon 
River 
a
hundred years ago.
The major sources
of fresh water are the
rivers, 
ponds,
springs 
and
glaciers. 
The
ocean bodies and
the seas contain
salty water. The

and then arrange the

them. Spray the

Take 2 litres of water. Let it represent the total
water on the surface of the earth. Measure out
12 spoons of water from this vessel into another
bowl. The water that is left behind in the vessel
represents the salty water found in oceans and
seas. This water is obviously not fit for
consuming. It is saline (contains salts).
The 12 spoons of water that was taken in a
bowl is the total amount of fresh water on earth.
The figure shows us the distribution of this fresh
water. See for yourself how much water can
actually be used by you.

DISTRIBUTION OF WATER BODIES
We all know that three-fourth of the earth surface is
covered by water. If there is more water than land on
this earth, why do so many countries face water scarcity?
Is all the water on earth available to us? The following

Water distribution can be demonstrated by a simple

OCEAN CIRCULATION
There is something magical about walking bare feet
on the seashore. The wet sand on the beach, the cool
breeze, the seabirds, the smell of the salt in the air
and music of the waves; everything is so fascinating.
Unlike the calm waters of ponds and lakes, ocean water
keeps moving continuously. It is never still. The
movements that occur in oceans can be broadly
categorised as: waves, tides and currents.

Waves
When you are playing throw ball on the beach and the
ball falls into the water, what happens? It is fun to watch
how the ball gets washed
back to the shore by the
waves. When the water on the
surface of the ocean rises and
falls alternately, they are
called waves.
Do you know?
Tsunami is a
Japanese word that
means “Harbour
waves” as the
harbours get
destroyed whenever
there is tsunami.
TSUNAMI – THE EARTH’S PANDEMONIUM
Tsunami or the harbour wave struck havoc in the Indian Ocean on the
26 December 2004. The wave was the result of the earthquake that had
its epicenter close to the western boundary of Sumatra. The magnitude
of the earthquake was 9.0 on the Richter scale. As the Indian plate
went under the Burma plate, there was a sudden movement of the sea
floor, causing the earthquake. The ocean floor was displaced by about
10 – 20m and tilted in a downwardly direction. A huge mass of ocean
water flowed to fill in the gap that was being created by the displacement.
This marked the withdrawal of the water mass from the coastlines of
the landmasses in the south and southeast Asia. After thrusting of the
Indian plate below the Burma plate, the water mass rushed back towards
the coastline. Tsunami travelled at a speed of about 800km. per hour,
comparable to speed of commercial aircraft and completely washed away
Do you know?
Waves are formed
when winds scrape
across the ocean
surface. The stronger
the wind blows, the
bigger the wave
becomes.

Fig. 5.4: Waves
During a storm, the winds blowing at very high speed
form huge waves. These may cause tremendous
destruction. An earthquake, a volcanic eruption or
underwater landslides can shift large amounts of ocean
water. As a result a huge tidal wave called tsunami, that
may be as high as 15m. is formed. The largest tsunami
ever measured was 150m. high. These waves travel at a
speed of more than 700 km. per hour. The tsunami of
2004 caused wide spread damage in the coastal areas of
India. The Indira point in the Andaman and Nicobar
islands got submerged after the tsunami.

some of the islands in the Indian ocean. The Indira point in the Andaman
and Nicobar islands that marked the southernmost point of India got
completely submerged. As the wave moved from earthquake epicenter
from Sumatra towards the Andaman islands and Sri Lanka the wave
length decreased with decreasing depth of water. The travel speed also
declined from 700-900km. per hour to less than 70km. per hour. Tsunami
waves travelled upto a depth of 3 km. from the coast killing more than
10,000 people and affected more than lakh of houses. In India, the
worst affected were the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu,
Kerala, Puducherry and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.
While the earthquake cannot be predicted in advance, it is possible
to give a three-hour notice of a potential tsunami. Such early warning
systems are in place across the Pacific ocean, but not in the Indian
Ocean. Tsunamis are rare in the Indian Ocean as the seismic activity
is less as compared to the Pacific.
Destruction caused by tsunami on Tamil Nadu Coast
The tsunami that ravaged the South and South east Asian coasts in
December 2004, is the most devastating tsunami in the last several
hundred years. The large damage caused to life and property was
primarily a result of lack of monitoring, the early warning systems and
knowledge among the coast dwellers of Indian ocean.
The first indication that tsunami is approaching is the rapid
withdrawal of water from the coastal region, followed by destructive
wave. When this happened on the coast, instead of people going to high
ground, they started assembling at the coast to view the miracle. As a
consequence there was a large casualty of curious onlookers when the
gigantic wave (tsunami) struck.
Tides
The rhythmic rise and fall of ocean water twice in a
day is called a tide. It is high tide when water covers
much of the shore by rising to its highest level. It is
low tide when water falls to its lowest level and recedes
from the shore.
Reprint 2024-25


36
OUR ENVIRONMENT
The strong gravitational pull
exerted by the sun and the moon
on the earth’s surface causes the
tides. The water of the earth closer
to the moon gets pulled under
the influence of the moon’s
gravitational force and causes high
tide. During the full moon and new
moon days, the sun, the moon and
the earth are in the same line and
the tides are highest. These tides
are called spring tides. But when
the moon is in its first and last
quarter, the ocean waters get drawn
in diagonally opposite directions by
the gravitational pull of sun and
moon resulting in low tides. These
tides are called neap tides (Fig. 5.5).
High tides help in navigation.
They raise the water level close to
the shores. This helps the ships to
arrive at the harbour more easily.
The high tides also help in fishing.
Many more fish come closer to the
shore during the high tide. This enables fishermen
to get a plentiful catch. The rise and fall of water due
to tides is being used to generate electricity in
some places.
OCEAN CURRENTS
Ocean currents are streams of water flowing constantly
on the ocean surface in definite directions. The ocean
currents may be warm or cold (Fig. 5.6). Generally,
the warm ocean currents originate near the equator
and move towards the poles. The cold currents carry
water from polar or higher latitudes to tropical or lower
latitudes. The Labrador Ocean current is cold current
while the Gulf Stream is a warm current. The ocean
current influence the temperature conditions of the
area. Warm currents bring about warm temperature
over land surface. The areas where the warm and cold
currents meet provide the best fishing grounds of the
