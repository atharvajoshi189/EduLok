  Poverty as a Challenge
  29
Overview
This chapter deals with one of the
challenges faced by independent India—
poverty. After discussing this multi-
dimensional problem through examples,
the chapter discusses the way poverty is
analysed by social scientists. Poverty
trends in India and the world are
illustrated through the concept of the
poverty line. Causes of poverty as well as
anti-poverty measures taken by the
government are also discussed. The
chapter ends with broadening the official
concept of poverty into human poverty.

of multidimensional poverty has fallen from
approximately 55 per cent in 2005–06,
25 per cent in 2015–16 and to 15 per cent
in 2019–21. It is also expected that
multidimensional poverty will soon
reach single digit.

wife and four children aged between 12
years to six months. He has to send
money home to his old parents who live
in a village near Ramgarh. His father,
a landless labourer, and his brother
who lives in Hazaribagh depend on Ram
Saran for sustenance. Ram Saran lives
in a one-room rented house in a
crowded basti in the outskirts of the
city. It is a temporary shack built of
bricks and clay tiles. His wife Santa
Devi, works as a part time maid in a
few houses and manages to earn
another `1500. They manage a meagre
meal of dal and rice twice a day, but
there is never enough for all of them.
His elder son works as a helper in a
tea shop to supplement the family’s
income and earns another `700 while
his 10-year old daughter goes to school
and takes care of the younger siblings.
They have only two pairs of hand-me-
down clothes each. New ones are
bought only when the old clothes
become unwearable. Shoes are a luxury.
The younger one relishes the dal-rice
served at school.
Rural case
Lakha Singh belongs to a small village
near Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. His
family does not own any land. So, they
do odd jobs for the big farmers. Work
is erratic and so is income. At times
they get paid `200 for a hard day’s
work. But often it is in kind like a few
kilograms of wheat or dal or even
vegetables for toiling in the farm
throughout the day. The family of six
are barely able to  manage two square
meals a day. Lakha lives in a kuchha
hut on the outskirts of the village. The
women of the family spend the day
chopping fodder and collecting
firewood in the fields. His father, a
tuberculosis patient, passed away two
years ago due to lack of medication.
His mother now suffers from the same
disease and life is slowly ebbing away.
Although, the village has a primary
school, Lakha never went there but
he is happy to find his children going
to school. New clothes happen once
in a few years. Even soap and oil
are a luxury for the family.

Poverty as a Challenge  
  31
These two typical cases illustrate many
dimensions of poverty. They show that
poverty means hunger and lack of shelter.
This also speaks about a situation in which
parents are not able to give their children
nutritious food three times a day or a
situation where sick people cannot afford
treatment. Poverty also means lack of
clean water and sanitation facilities. It also
means lack of a regular job with decent
minimum wages. Above all, it means living
with a sense of helplessness. Poor people
are in a situation in which they are ill-
treated at almost every place, in farms,
factories, government offices, hospitals,
railway stations, etc. Obviously, nobody
would like to live in poverty.
One of the biggest challenges of
independent India has been to bring
millions of its people out of abject poverty.
Mahatama Gandhi said that India would
be truly independent only when the poorest
of its people become free of human
suffering.
Poverty as seen by social scientists
Since poverty has many facets, social
scientists look at it through a variety of
indicators. Usually the indicators are used
to relate with the levels of income and
consumption. In recent times, a variety of
other indicators have also been used to
recognise whether a person is poor or not.
For example, National Multidimensional
Poverty Index is calculated on the basis of
three broad indicators: health indicators
like nutrition, child and adolescent
mortality, maternal health. Education
indicators like years of schooling and school
attendance, and standard of living indicator
like cooking fuel, sanitation, drinking water,
housing, electricity, assets, bank account.
Indicators such as social exclusion and
vulnerability are also used to understand
poverty (see box).
Social Exclusion
According to this concept, poverty
must be seen in terms of the poor
having to live only in a poor
surrounding with other poor people,
excluded from enjoying social
equality of better-off people in better
surroundings. Social exclusion can
be both a cause as well as a
consequence of poverty in the usual
sense. Broadly, it is a process through
which individuals or groups are
excluded from facilities, benefits and
opportunities that others (the
“better-offs”) 
enjoy. 
A 
typical
example is the working of the caste
system in India in which people
belonging to certain castes are
excluded from equal opportunities.
Social exclusion thus may lead to
or can cause more damage than
having a very low income.
Vulnerability
Vulnerability 
to poverty is a
measure, which describes the
greater 
probability 
of 
certain
communities (say, members of a
backward caste) or individuals (such
as 
a 
widow 
or 
a 
physically
handicapped person) of becoming or
remaining poor. Vulnerability is
determined by the options available
to different communities for finding
an alternative living in terms of
assets, education, health and job
opportunities. Further, it is analysed
on the basis of the greater risks these
groups face at the time of natural
disasters (earthquakes, tsunami).
Additional analysis is made of their
social and economic ability to handle
these risks. In fact, vulnerability
describes the greater probability of
being more adversely affected than
other people when bad time comes
for everybody, whether a flood or an
earthquake or simply a fall in the
availability of jobs!

  Economics
Poverty Line
At the centre of the discussion on poverty
is the concept of the ‘poverty line’. A
common method used to measure poverty
is based on the income or consumption
levels. The term ‘consumption’ means the
amount spent on various items such as
food, clothing, etc., by a family. A person
is considered poor if his or her income or
consumption level falls below a given
‘minimum level’ necessary to fulfill the
basic needs. What is necessary to satisfy
basic needs is different at different times
and in different countries. Therefore,
poverty line may vary with time and place.
Each country uses an imaginary line that
is considered appropriate for its existing
level of development and its accepted
minimum social norms. For example, a
person not having a car in the United
States may be considered poor. In India,
owning a car is still considered a luxury.
While determining the poverty line in
India, till a few years ago, a minimum
level of food requirement, clothing,
footwear, fuel and electricity, educational
and medical needs, etc., were taken into
consideration. The physical quantities  of
these needs were multiplied by their
prices in rupees. The formula for food
requirement while estimating the
poverty line was based on the desired
calorie requirement. Food items, such
as cereals, pulses, vegetables, milk, oil,
sugar, etc., together provided these
needed calories. The calorie needs vary
depending on age, sex and the type of
work that a person does. The accepted
average calorie requirement in India was
2400 calories per person per day in rural
areas and 2100 calories per person per
day in urban areas. Since people living
in rural areas engage themselves in more
physical work, calorie requirements in
rural areas were considered to be higher
than in urban areas. The bare monetary
expenditure per capita needed for
buying these calorie requirements in terms
of food grains, etc., and reported by
families has been considered as poverty
line. This amount was revised periodically,
taking into consideration the rise in prices.
Based on the global developments, the
Government of India has begun to
estimate the proportion of poor in India
using 12 developmental indicators, which
is popularly known as Multidimensional
Poverty Index (see box). This national
index complements the income or
consumption expenditure based poverty
measurement because it measures and
compares deprivations directly.
  Let’s Discuss
Discuss the following:
•
What could be the difference between
consumption based expenditure
Poverty 
Line 
and 
National
Multidimensional Poverty Index?
•
What do you think would be the
“minimum necessary level” in your
locality?
Poverty Estimates
Based on the methodology described in
the previous section, the number and
proportion of poor people in India, called
Head Count Ratio (HCR),  is estimated.
Table 3.1 shows that during the 1990s,
the 
proportion 
of 
‘consumption
expenditure based’ poor declined from
45 to 37 per cent. However, the number
of poor remained at about 40 crores.
During 2000–2011, both the proportion
and the number of poor declined. The
proportion of multidimensional poor
during 2015–2021 declined from 25 to
15 percent. As per the official record,
13.5 
crore 
people 
have 
escaped
multidimensional poverty during this
period. Specifically deprivation  against
various indicators have declined more
sharply in rural areas than in urban
areas.

Twelve Indicators of National Multidimensional Poverty Index
NITI Aayog, a Government of India organisation evolved the National Multidimensional
Poverty Index (NMPI) using the following 12 indicators. If an individual is found
deprived on these indicators, he or she is considered as multidimensional poor.
1. Nutrition: A household is considered deprived if any child between the ages
of 0 to 59 months, or woman between the ages of 15 to 49 years, or man
between the ages of 15 to 54 years is found to be undernourished.
2. Child-Adolescent Mortality: A household is deprived if any child or adolescent
under 18 years of age has died in the household in the five-year period
preceding the survey.
3.
Maternal Health: A household is deprived if any woman in the household
who has given birth in the 5 years preceding the survey has not received
assistance from trained skilled medical personnel during the recent childbirth.
4. Years of Schooling: A household is deprived if not even one member of the
household aged 10 years or older has completed six years of schooling.
5. School attendance: A household is deprived if any school-aged child is not
attending school up to the age at which he/she would complete class.
6. Cooking Fuel: A household is deprived if a household cooks with dung,
agricultural crops, shrubs, wood, charcoal, or coal.
7. Sanitation: A household is deprived if the household has unimproved or no
sanitation facility or it is improved but shared with other households.
8. Drinking Water: A household is deprived if the household does not have access
to improved drinking water or safe drinking water is at least a 30-minute
walk  from home (as a round trip).
9. Housing: A household is deprived if the household has inadequate housing: the floor
is made of natural materials, or the roof or wall are made of rudimentary materials.
10. Electricity: A household is deprived if the household has no electricity.
11. Assets: A household is deprived if the household does not own more than one
of these assets: radio, TV, telephone, computer, animal cart, bicycle, motorbike,
or refrigerator; and does not own a car or truck.
12. Bank Account: A household is deprived if no household member has a bank
account or a post office account.

  Let’s Discuss
Study Table 3.1 and answer the following
questions:
•
Even if poverty ratio declined between
1993–94 and 2004–05, why did the
number of poor remain at about 407
million?
•
Are the dynamics of poverty reduction
the same in rural and urban India?
  Let’s Discuss
Study the Graph 3.1 and do the following:
•
Identify the three states where the HCR
is the highest.
•
Identify the three states where HCR
is the lowest.
•
List the states which have HCR lower
or higher than HCR for all India.
Inter-State Disparities
Poverty in India also has another aspect
or dimension. The proportion of poor people
is not the same in every state (see graph
3.1). Although state level poverty has
witnessed a significant decline from the
levels of early seventies, the success rate of
reducing poverty varies from state to state.
It is pertinent to note that the states of
Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Punjab,
Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh,
Haryana and Maharashtra had an HCR
which was less than 10 per cent in 2019–
21. In the meantime, remarkable strides
have been made by States like Bihar, Uttar
Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.
Studies also show states following different
steps to reduce poverty. For example,
Kerala has focused more on human
resource development. In West Bengal,
land reform measures have helped in
reducing poverty. In Andhra Pradesh and
Tamil Nadu public distribution of food
grains have been responsible for the
improvement.
Vulnerable Groups
The proportion of people below poverty
line is also not same for all social groups
and economic categories in India. Social
groups, which are most vulnerable to
poverty are Scheduled Caste and
Scheduled Tribe households. Similarly,
among the economic groups, the most
vulnerable 
groups 
are 
the 
rural
agricultural-labour households and the
urban casual-labour households. Graph

in all these groups. Although the average
of people below poverty line for all groups
in India is 22; however, 43 out of 100 (see
graph 3.2) people belonging to Scheduled
Tribes are not able to meet their basic
needs. Similarly, 34 per cent of casual
workers in urban areas are below poverty
line. About 34 per cent of casual farm
labour (in rural areas) and 29 per cent
of Scheduled Castes are also poor. The
double disadvantage of being a landless
casual wage labour household in the
socially disadvantaged social groups of
the scheduled caste or the scheduled
tribe 
population 
highlights 
the
seriousness of the problem. Some recent
studies have shown that except for the
scheduled tribe households, all the other
three groups (i.e., Scheduled Castes,
rural agricultural labourers and the
urban casual labour households) have
seen a decline in poverty in the 1990s.
Apart from these social groups, there
is also inequality of incomes within a
family. In poor families all suffer, but
some suffer more than others. In some
cases, women, elderly people and female
infants are denied equal access to
resources available to the family.

Global Poverty Scenario
Is India the only country having poor
people? For making comparisons between
developing countries, many international
organisations like the World Bank use a
uniform standard for the poverty line:
minimum availability of the equivalent of
$2.15 per person per day. The proportion
of people in different countries living in
extreme economic poverty— defined by the
World Bank as living on less than $2.15
per day— has fallen from 16.27 per cent
in 2010 to 9.05 per cent in 2019. Why $
(dollar) has been used there? In India, we
use rupee as a national currency, each
country has its own currency. American
dollar is used by international agencies to
compare data across countries.
Although there has been a substantial
reduction in global poverty, it is marked
with great regional differences. Poverty
declined substantially in China and
Southeast Asian countries as a result
of rapid economic growth and massive
investments 
in 
human 
resource
development (Read table 3.2 and graph
3.3 and 3.4). The proportion of poor in
China has become 0.1 per cent in 2020.
The World Bank reports reveal that in the
countries of South Asia (India, Pakistan,

Sri Lanka, Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan,
Afghanistan and Maldives) the decline
has also been rapid from 13 per cent in
2017 to 11 per cent in 2021. With decline
in the percentage of the poor, the number
of poor has also declined significantly from
233 million in 2017 to 207 million in 2021.

Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
This requires urgent action from the part
of both the developed and the developing
countries (see box).
Developed countries ought to support
the developing countries in the endeavour
of ending poverty, improve health and
education, reduce inequalities, tackling
climate change and promote sustainable
development.
The United Nations (UN) Organisation,
an international organisation works

poverty. 
In 
collaboration 
with
governments of member countries, UN
came out with 17 Sustainable

targets to be achieved by the countries
who are members of UN. One of the
targets of SDG 1 is reducing the
proportion of men, women and children
in all ages living in poverty in all its
dimensions at least to half by 2030. The
decline in the proportion of poor reflects
India’s commitment to achieve the
target related to Goal 1: No Poverty (End

  Economics
Causes of Poverty
There were number of causes for the
widespread poverty in India. One historical
reason is the low level of economic
development under the British colonial
administration. The policies of the colonial
government ruined traditional handicrafts
and discouraged development of industries
like textiles. The low rate of growth persisted
until the 1980s. This resulted in less job
opportunities and low growth rate of
incomes. This was accompanied by a high
growth of population.
With the spread of irrigation and the
Green Revolution, many job opportunities were
created in the agriculture sector. But the impact
was limited to some parts of India. The
industries, both in the public and the private
sector, did provide some jobs. But these were
not enough to absorb all the job seekers.
Unable to find jobs with better income in cities,
many people started working as rickshaw
pullers, vendors, construction workers,
domestic servants, etc. With irregular small
incomes, these people could not afford
reasonable shelter. They started living in slums
on the outskirts of the cities and the problems

of poverty, largely a rural phenomenon also
became a feature of urban India.
Another feature of high poverty rates
has been the huge income inequalities.
One of the major reasons for this is the
unequal distribution of land and other
resources. Despite many policies, we have
not been able to tackle the issue of
poverty. Major policy initiatives like land
reforms which aimed at redistribution of
assets in rural areas have not been
implemented effectively by most of the
state 
governments. 
Effective
implementation of policy could have
improved the life of millions of rural poor.
 Many other socio-cultural and
economic factors are also responsible for
poverty. In order to fulfil social
obligations and observe religious
ceremonies, people in India, including
the very poor, spend a lot of money and
waste their hard earned income. Small
farmers need money to buy agricultural
inputs like seeds, fertilizer, pesticides,
etc. Since poor people hardly have any
savings, they borrow or accept loan at
higher risk. Unable to repay because of
poverty, 
they 
become 
victims 
of
indebtedness. So the high level of
indebtedness is both the cause and effect
of poverty.

Anti-Poverty Measures
Removal of poverty has been one of the
major objectives of Indian developmental
strategy. The current anti-poverty
strategy of the government is based
broadly on two factors — (i) promotion
of economic growth (ii) targeted anti-
poverty programmes.
Over a period of thirty years of
independent India, lasting up to the early
eighties, there were little per capita
income growth and not much reduction
in poverty. Official poverty estimates
which were about 45 per cent in the early
1950s remained the same even in the
early eighties. Since the eighties, India’s
economic growth has been one of the
fastest in the world. The growth rate
jumped from the average of about 3.5
per cent a year in the 1970s to about 6
per cent during the 1980s and 1990s.
The two decades of 21st century
(2000–2020) has also witnessed the rapid
economic development. The higher
growth rates have significantly helped in
the reduction of poverty. Therefore, it is
becoming clear that there is a strong link
between economic growth and poverty
reduction. Economic growth widens
opportunities and provides the resources
needed to invest in human development.
This also encourages people to send
their children, including the girl child, to
schools in the hope of getting better
economic returns by investing in
education. The poor may not be able to
take advantage from the opportunities
created by economic growth. However,
growth in the agriculture sector is much
below expectations. This has a direct
bearing on poverty. A large number of poor
people live in villages and are dependent
on agriculture.
In these circumstances, there is a clear
need 
for 
targeted 
anti-poverty
programmes. Although there are many
schemes which are formulated to affect
poverty directly or indirectly. Some of them
are worth mentioning.
Mahatma Gandhi National Rural
Employment Guarantee  Act, 2005 aims
to provide 100 days of wage employment
to every household to ensure livelihood
security in rural areas. It also aimed at
sustainable development to address the
cause of drought, deforestration and soil
erosion. One-third of the proposed jobs
have been reserved for women under this
act. The wage rate for unskilled manual
workers is revised regularly,
Pradhan Mantri Poshan Shakti
Abhiyan (PM Poshan) is a flagship
programme of Government of India. It
was initiated with twin purpose — (i) to
improve the nutritional requirement
especially calorie and the protein intake
of the child, (ii) improve the school
enrolment and eliminate the drop out
from the school. It targets students from
Classes I to VIII in Government,
Government aided schools and special
training centres under the Right to
Education Act.
This scheme is implemented with the
support of local governments and various
community organisations. This programme
encourages poor children, belonging to
disadvantaged sections, to attend school
more regularly and helps them concentrate
on classroom activities.

The Challenges Ahead
Poverty has certainly declined in India. But
despite the progress, poverty reduction
remains India’s most compelling challenge.
Wide disparities in poverty are visible
between rural and urban areas and
among different States also. Certain social
and economic groups are more vulnerable
to poverty. Poverty reduction is expected
to make better India. This would be
possible mainly due to higher economic
growth, increasing focus on universal
education, declining population growth;
empowerment of the women and the
economically weaker sections of society
would also facilitate the same.
The income based definition of poverty
captures only a limited part of what
poverty really means to people. It is about
a ‘minimum’ subsistence level of living
rather than a ‘reasonable’ level of living.
Many scholars advocate that we must
broaden the concept into human poverty. A
large number of people may have been able
to feed themselves. But do they have
education? Or shelter? Or health care?
Or job security? Or self-confidence? Are
they free from caste and gender
discrimination? Is the practice of child
labour 
still 
common? 
Worldwide
experience shows that with development,
the definition of what constitutes poverty
also changes. In this chapter we have
looked at the different approaches to
measure 
poverty. 
The 
National
Multidimensional Poverty Index put
forward by NITI Aayog reveals that the
number 
and 
proportion 
of
multidimensionally poor has declined in
India. This may be due to the array of
Government interventions initiated in
recent years. What do you think?
Pradhan Mantri Surakshit Matritva
Abhiyan was launched in 2016 with the aim
to reduce maternal and infant mortality by
providing quality antenatal care to the
pregnant women throughout the country.
The scheme works towards  safe
pregnancies, deliveries and addresses gaps
in the service of the maternal care, to ensure
constant and regular treatment to the
beneficiaries. Services are provided on the
ninth day of every month. This programme
follows a systematic approach for
engagement with private practitioners,
motivating them to volunteer in the scheme
at government health facilities.
Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY)
aims towards women empowerment in
rural areas. It encourages the use of
smoke-free kitchen, thereby, saving them
from chronic respiratory disorders and
poor eye sights. It was launched in 2016
with an aim to provide clean cooking fuel
(liquefied petroleum gas or LPG) to
economically poor households especially
in the rural areas, who cook using
traditional methods by using either coal,
wood or cow dungs. Its target beneficiaries
are Below Poverty Line (BPL) households,
Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes,
forest dwellers and marginalised group
households. To encourage the use of LPG,
the scheme provides a completely free
connection, including the first refill  and
a stove.
Over the years there is an increase in
the LPG coverage throughout the country.
Connections are issued in the name of the
female member of the family. This scheme
also promotes environment sustainability
by reducing deforestation and carbon
emission generated from burning coal and
firewood. The use of clean cooking fuel,
i.e., LPG means less time and effort in
collecting firewood and encourages women
to participate in social and economic
activities.

  Poverty as a Challenge

  Summary
In this chapter, we have looked at the different approaches of measuring poverty. The National
Multidimensional Poverty Index, put forward by NITI Aayog in collaboration with UNDP and Oxford
Policy and Human Development Initiative reveals that on the Headcount Ratio of multidimensionally
poor, there has been a considerable reduction. Even when some of the states like Kerala and Tamil
Nadu have reached less than 10 per cent on the HCR front, much is yet to be achieved by the other
states. However, it is also to be noted that due to the array of Government intervention policies
between 2005–06 and 2019–21 there has been significant decline in the number of MPI poor in the
states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.
