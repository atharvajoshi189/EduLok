ou may have seen people perform rituals of 
worship, or singing

or even repeating the name of God in silence, and 
noticed that some of them are moved to tears. Such 
intense devotion or love of God is the legacy of various 
since the eighth century.
The Idea of a Supreme God
Before large kingdoms emerged, different groups 
of people worshipped their own gods and goddesses. 
As people were brought together through the growth 
of towns, trade and empires, new ideas began to 
develop. The idea that all living things pass through 
countless cycles of birth and rebirth performing good 
deeds and bad came to be widely accepted. Similarly, 
the idea that all human beings are not equal even at 
birth gained ground during this period. The belief that 
social privileges came from birth in a “noble” family or 
a “high” caste was the subject of many learned texts.
Many people were uneasy with such ideas and 
turned to the teachings of the Buddha or the Jainas 
according to which it was possible to overcome social 
differences and break the cycle of rebirth through 
personal effort. Others felt attracted to the idea of a 
Supreme God who could deliver humans from such 
bondage if approached with devotion (or bhakti). 
This idea, advocated in the 
 grew in 
popularity in the early centuries of the Common Era.

TO THE DIVINE
The beginning of 
Bhakti
Worship of certain 
deities, which 
became a central 
feature of later 
Hinduism, gained in 
importance. These 
deities included 
Shiva, Vishnu, and 
goddesses such as 
Durga. These deities 
were worshipped 
through Bhakti, an 
idea that became 
very popular at 
this time. Bhakti is 
generally understood 
as a person’s 
devotion to his or 
her chosen deity. 
Anybody, whether 
rich or poor, belonging 
to the so-called ‘high’ 
or ‘low’ castes, man 
or woman, could 
follow the path of 
Bhakti. The idea of 
Bhakti is present in 
the Bhagavad Gita, a 
sacred book of  
the Hindus.

Shiva, Vishnu and 
Durga as supreme 
deities came to 
be worshipped 
through elaborate 
rituals. At the 
same time, gods 
and goddesses

identified with 
Shi va, Vish n u 
or Durga. In the 
process, local myths and legends became a part of the 
Puranic stories, and methods of worship recommended 
in the Puranas were introduced into the local cults. 
Eventually the Puranas also laid down that it was 
possible for devotees to receive the grace of God 
regardless of their caste status. The idea of bhakti 
became so popular that even Buddhists and Jainas 
adopted these beliefs.
Bhakti in South India –  
Nayanars and Alvars
The seventh to ninth centuries saw the emergence of 
new religious movements, led by the Nayanars (saints 
devoted to Shiva) and Alvars (saints devoted to Vishnu) 
who came from all castes including those considered 
“untouchable” like the Pulaiyar and the Panars. They 
were sharply critical of the Buddhists and Jainas 
and preached ardent love of Shiva or Vishnu as the 
path to salvation. They drew upon the ideals of love 
and heroism as found in the Sangam literature (the 
earliest example of Tamil literature, composed during 
the early centuries of the Common Era) and blended 
them with the values of bhakti. The Nayanars and 
Alvars went from place to place composing exquisite 
poems in praise of the deities enshrined in the villages 
they visited, and set them to music.
You can observe 
this process of 
local myths and 
legends receiving 
wider acceptance 
even today. Can 
you find some 
examples 
around you?

Nayanars and Alvars
There were 63 Nayanars, who belonged to different 
social backgrounds, such as potters, “untouchable” 
workers, peasants, hunters, soldiers, Brahmanas and 
chiefs. The best known among them were Appar, 
Sambandar, Sundarar and Manikkavasagar. There are 
two sets of compilations of their songs – Tevaram and 
Tiruvacakam. 
There were 12 Alvars, who came from equally 
divergent backgrounds, the best known being 
Periyalvar, his daughter Andal, Tondaradippodi Alvar 
and Nammalvar. Their songs were compiled in the Divya 
Prabandham.
Between the tenth and twelfth centuries, the Chola 
and Pandya kings built elaborate temples around many 
of the shrines visited by the saint-poets, strengthening 
the links between the bhakti tradition and temple 
worship. This was also the time when their poems 
were compiled. Besides, hagiographies or religious 
biographies of the Alvars and Nayanars were also 
composed. Today we use these texts as sources for 
writing histories of the bhakti tradition.

Philosophy and Bhakti 
of India, was born in Kerala in the eighth century. 
He was an advocate of Advaita or the doctrine of 
the oneness of the individual soul and the Supreme 
God which is the Ultimate Reality. He taught that 
Brahman, the only or Ultimate Reality, was formless 
and without any attributes. He considered the world 
around us to be an illusion or 
, and preached 
renunciation of the world and adoption of the path of 
knowledge to understand the true nature of Brahman 
and attain salvation.  
Ramanuja, born in Tamil Nadu in the eleventh 
century, was deeply influenced by the Alvars. 
According to him the best means of attaining 
salvation was through intense devotion to Vishnu. 
Vishnu in His grace helps the devotee to attain the 
bliss of union with Him. He propounded the doctrine 
even when united with the Supreme God remained 
distinct. Ramanuja’s doctrine greatly inspired the 
new strand of bhakti which developed in north 
India subsequently.  
Basavanna’s Virashaivism
We noted earlier the connection between the Tamil 
bhakti movement and temple worship. This in turn 
led to a reaction that is best represented in the 
Virashaiva movement initiated by Basavanna and his 
companions like Allama Prabhu and Akkamahadevi. 
This movement began in Karnataka in the 
mid-twelfth century. The Virashaivas argued strongly 
for the equality of all human beings and against 
Brahmanical ideas about caste and the treatment of 
women. They were also against all forms of ritual and 
idol worship.

Virashaiva vachanas
These are vachanas or sayings attributed to Basavanna:
The rich,
Will make temples for Shiva.
What shall I, 
A poor man,
Do?
My legs are pillars,
The body the shrine,
The head a cupola
Of gold.
Listen, O Lord of the meeting rivers,
Things standing shall fall,
But the moving ever shall stay.

Bhakti Movement in the Decean
From the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries, 
Maharashtra saw a great number of saint-poets, whose 
songs in simple Marathi continue to inspire people. 
The most important among them were Dnyaneshwar 
(Gyaneshwar), Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram as well 
as women like Sakhubai and the family of Chokhamela, 
who belonged to the “untouchable” Mahar caste. This 
regional tradition of bhakti focused on the Vitthala (a 
form of Vishnu) temple in Pandharpur, as well as on 
the notion of a personal god residing in the hearts of 
all people. 
These saint-poets rejected all forms of ritualism, 
outward display of piety and social differences 
based on birth. In fact, they even rejected the idea of 
renunciation and preferred to live with their families, 
earning their livelihood like any other person, while 
humbly serving fellow human beings in need. A new 
humanist idea emerged as they insisted that bhakti

lay in sharing others’ pain. As the famous Gujarati 
saint Narsi Mehta said, “They are Vaishnavas who 
understand the pain of others.”
Questioning the social order
This is an abhang (Marathi devotional hymn) of Sant 
Tukaram: 
with the battered and the beaten
Mark him as a saint
For God is with him
He holds
Every forsaken man
Close to his heart 
He treats 
A slave
As his own son
Says Tuka
I won’t be tired 
to repeat again
Such a man
Is God 
In person.
 Here is an abhang composed by Chokhamela’s son:
You made us low caste,
Why don’t you face that fact, Great Lord?
Our whole life – left-over food to eat.
You should be ashamed of this.
You have eaten in our home.
How can you deny it?
Chokha’s (son) Karmamela asks
Why did you give me life?
Discuss the ideas about the social order expressed 
in these compositions.

Nathpanthis, Siddhas and Yogis
A number of religious groups that 
emerged during this period criticised the 
ritual and other aspects of conventional 
religion and the social order, using 
simple, logical arguments. Among them 
were the Nathpanthis, Siddhacharas 
and Yogis. They advocated renunciation 
of the world. To them the path to 
salvation lay in meditation on the 
formless Ultimate Reality and the 
realisation of oneness with it. To achieve 
this, they advocated intense training of 
the mind and body through practices 
like 
, breathing exercises 
and meditation. These groups became 
particularly popular among “low” castes. 
Their criticism of conventional religion 
created the ground for devotional 
religion to become a popular force in 
northern India.

poems expressing their feelings, and a rich literature 
in prose, including anecdotes and fables, developed 
were Ghazzali, Rumi and Sadi. Like the Nathpanthis, 
can be trained to look at the world in a different way. 
They developed elaborate methods of training using

 Finding the Lord 
Jalaluddin Rumi was a great thirteenth-century Sufi poet 
from Iran who wrote in Persian. Here is an excerpt from 
his work:
He was not on the Cross of the Christians. I went to the Hindu 
temples. In none of them was there any sign. He was not on 
Mecca. He was not there. I asked about him from Avicenna 
looked into my heart. In that, his place, I saw him. He was 
in no other place.
New Religious Developments in  
North India
The period after the thirteenth century saw 
a new wave of the bhakti movement in North 
India. This was an age when Islam, Brahmanical 
another. We saw that new kingdoms (Chapters 2, 3 
and 4) were emerging, and people were taking up new 
people, especially craftspersons, peasants, traders and 
labourers, thronged to listen to these 
new saints and spread their ideas.
Some of them like Kabir and Baba 
Guru Nanak rejected all orthodox 
religions. Others like Tulsidas and 
Surdas accepted existing beliefs 
and practices but wanted to make 
these accessible to all. Tulsidas 
conceived of God in the form of 
Rama. Tulsidas’s composition, the 
 written in Awadhi 
(a language used in eastern Uttar 
Pradesh), is important both as an

emphasised devotion to Vishnu, and composed poems

up

practice that continues to date.
This tradition also included saints like Dadu Dayal, 
Ravidas and Mirabai. Mirabai was a Rajput princess 
married into the royal family of Mewar in the sixteenth 
century. Mirabai became a disciple of Ravidas, a saint 
from a caste considered “untouchable”. She was

devoted to Krishna and composed innumerable 
expressing her intense devotion. Her songs 
also openly challenged the norms of the “upper” castes 
and became popular with the masses in Rajasthan 
and Gujarat.
A unique feature of most of the saints is that their 
works were composed in regional languages and could 
be sung. They became immensely popular and were 
handed down orally from generation to generation. 
Usually the poorest, most deprived communities and 
women transmitted these songs, often adding their own 
experiences. Thus the songs as we have them today are 
as much a creation of the saints as of generations of 
people who sang them. They have become a part of our 
living popular culture.

to know of his ideas from a vast collection of verses 
called 
 and 
 said to have been composed 
by him and sung by wandering 
singers. Some 
of these were later collected and preserved in the 
 
 and

In search of the True Lord
Here is a composition of Kabir: 
O Allah-Ram present in all living beings
Have mercy on your servants, O Lord!
Why bump your head on the ground,
Why bathe your body in water?
You kill and you call yourself “humble”
But your vices you conceal.
Twenty-four times the Brahmana keeps 
the ekadasi fast
While the Qazi observes the Ramzan
Tell me why does he set aside the eleven 
months 
To seek spiritual fruit in the twelfth?
Hari dwells in the East, they say
And Allah resides in the West,
Search for him in your heart, in the heart 
of your heart;
There he dwells, Rahim-Ram.
In what ways are the ideas in this poem similar 
to or different from those of Basavanna and 
Jalaluddin Rumi?

Kabir’s teachings were based on a complete, indeed 
vehement, rejection of the major religious traditions. 
His teachings openly ridiculed all forms of external 
worship of both Brahmanical Hinduism and Islam, 
the pre-eminence of the priestly classes and the caste 
system. The language of his poetry was a form of 
spoken Hindi widely understood by ordinary people. 
He also sometimes used cryptic language, which is 
Kabir believed in a formless Supreme God and 
preached that the only path to salvation was through 
bhakti or devotion. Kabir drew his followers from 
among both Hindus and Muslims.
A Closer Look: Baba Guru Nanak
We know more about Baba Guru Nanak (1469-1539) 
than about Kabir. Born at Talwandi (Nankana Sahib 
in Pakistan), he travelled widely before establishing a 
centre at Kartarpur (Dera Baba Nanak on the river Ravi). 
A regular worship that consisted of the singing of his 
own hymns was established there for his followers. 
Irrespective of their former 
creed, caste or gender, his 
followers ate together in the 
common kitchen (
The 
sacred space thus created by 
Baba Guru Nanak was known 
as 
. It is now known 
as Gurdwara.
Before his death in 1539, 
Baba Guru Nanak appointed 
one of his followers as his 
successor. His name was Lehna 
but he came to be known as 
Guru Angad, signifying that 
he was a part of Baba Guru 
Nanak himself. Guru Angad 
compiled the compositions 
of Baba Guru Nanak, to 
which he added his own in

a new script known as Gurmukhi. 
The three successors of Guru Angad 
also wrote under the name of “Nanak” 
and all of their compositions were 
compiled by Guru Arjan in 1604. To this 
compilation were added the writings of 
Kabir, Bhagat Namdev and Guru Tegh 
Bahadur. In 1706, this compilation was 
authenticated by Guru Tegh Bahadur’s 
son and successor, Guru Gobind Singh. 
It is now known as 
, 
the holy scripture of the Sikhs.
The number of Baba Guru Nanak’s 
followers increased through the sixteenth century 
under his successors. They belonged to a number 
of castes but traders, agriculturists, artisans and 
craftsmen predominated. This may have something 
to do with Baba Guru Nanak’s insistence that his 
followers must be householders and should adopt 
productive and useful occupations. They were also 
expected to contribute to the general funds of the 
community of followers. 
By the beginning of the seventeenth century, the 
town of Ramdaspur (Amritsar) had developed around 
the central Gurdwara called Harmandar Sahib (Golden 
Temple). It was virtually self-governing and modern 
historians refer to the early-seventeenth-century Sikh 
community as ‘a state within the state’. The Mughal 
emperor Jahangir looked upon them as a potential 
threat and he ordered the execution of Guru Arjan 
in 1606.  The Sikh movement began to get politicised 
in the seventeenth century, a development which 
culminated in the institution of the 
 by Guru 
Gobind Singh in 1699. The community of the Sikhs, 
called the

development of the Sikh movement. The ideas

of Baba Guru Nanak had a huge impact on this 
development from the very beginning. He emphasised 
the importance of the worship of one God. He insisted 
that caste, creed or gender was irrelevant for attaining 
liberation. His idea of liberation was not that of a state 
of inert bliss but rather the pursuit of active life with 
a strong sense of social commitment. He himself used 
the terms 
, 
 and 
 for the essence of his 
teaching, which actually meant right worship, welfare 
of others and purity of conduct. His teachings are 
now remembered as 
, 
 and 
, which also underline the importance of right 
belief and worship, honest living, and helping others. 
Thus, Baba Guru Nanak’s idea of equality had social 
and political implications. This might partly explain 
the difference between the history of the followers of 
Baba Guru Nanak and the history of the followers of 
like Kabir, Ravidas and Dadu, whose ideas were very 
similar to those of Baba Guru Nanak.
