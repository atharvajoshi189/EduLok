NOTES FOR THE TEACHER
General
v
Learning a language means using it for a wide variety of
purposes. Language is best acquired when attention is
focused on meaning, not on form.
v
Words and phrases not closely related to objects and
action remain empty and lifeless to young learners.
Language comes alive when presented in meaning-making
contexts.
v
Words/phrases that are used to accomplish many useful
purposes follow a certain system inherent in the language
itself.
v
Learners become familiar with the system through
continuous exposure to the language in meaning-focused
situations.
v
Interaction, discussion and sharing of ideas among
learners provide opportunities that elicit ‘real’ information
about them and their experiences and opinions.
v
Encourage learners to work in pairs and small groups
and let them go beyond the textbook by providing a
variety of language inputs for spontaneous and natural
use of language.
v
Build on the exercises given in the textbook and design
more tasks/activities in keeping with learners’ interests,
needs and surroundings.  Employ free-response exercises
(with more than one possible response).
v
Promote reading habits through story-reading (not
merely teaching stories as texts), story-retelling, choral
reading, shared reading, etc.
v
Create class libraries for exchange of books and shared
reading.  The library may also move with children to the
next higher class.


2/HONEYCOMB
v
Introduce advertisement as a genre and discuss with the
learners about advertisements on social concerns such
as educating the girl child, protecting the environment,
saving water.
v
Poems need not be taught line by line, word by word.
You may give a model reading but let every child read
the poem on her/his own to feel the richness of language,
rhythm and music of words. Exercises accompanying the
poem are more for understanding the poem as a whole
than for teaching language items.
v
Encourage learners to tell new stories, narrate  anecdotes,
compose short poems in English or their own language,
talk about pictures, illustrations in the book and cartoons
in newspapers/magazines. Don’t get anxious about the
errors they will make. Constant exposure, practice and
correction in the form of feedback will help them improve
themselves by and by.
v
Every page has a column for words and meanings.
Encourage children to write down other words they  find
difficult, along with their meanings, in this column.
UNITS 1–3
Three Questions
Some suggestions given below are applicable to all prose
lessons in the book.
v
A Tolstoy story — the three questions in the opening
paragraph, though philosophical in nature, may be of
practical significance to individuals in self-realisation and
value inculcation.
v
Spend about 10 minutes discussing the questions the
king asks. Let children express their views.  Even if their
observations do not reveal any understanding of the
questions, the discussion session will provide an excellent
base for the work to follow.
v
The story is sectioned in two parts.  Each part may be sectioned
further according to convenience and time available.
v
‘Comprehension Check’ at the end of each section is a
recall of what they have read so far.  Design while-reading
comprehension exercises in the form of factual
2/HONEYCOMB


THREE QUESTIONS/3
comprehension questions, multiple choice questions
and/or completion of sentences, etc.
v
While covering portions of the text, either talk about the
illustrations or ask children to tell you about them.
Illustrations are there not merely for decoration but mainly
for comprehension.
v
Questions under ‘Working with the Text’ to be answered
orally, later to be written in the copybook.
v
At the end of the lesson, draw children’s attention to the
three questions in the context of the present period/class.
Isn’t the present period the right time to do as best
you can the task in hand jointly with the member(s)  of
the group for her/his good  and your own ?
The Squirrel
v
Drawing a squirrel or finding the picture of a squirrel
and describing it variously will commit learners’ interest
to the poem they are reading.
v
Help them find ‘wear’ and its usage in the dictionary.
Avoid fixed phrases like ‘wear and tear’ or ‘wear one’s
heart on one’s sleeve’, etc. Draw their attention to sentences
like the following.
• She wore  a plain dress but an enigmatic smile.
• Should a man wear a lady’s perfume ?
v
The illustration given in the book may generate comments
such as the following.
•
The squirrel’s tail looks like a question mark.
•
It reminds me of the mark of punctuation that comes
at the end of an interrogative sentence.
•
Looking at this squirrel, you might say it was asking
a question.  What is the question ?
•
The squirrel is wearing a long overcoat reaching the
tip of its tail.
•
If it begins to run now, its tail will look like the bushy
end of a painter’s brush.
NOTES FOR THE TEACHER/3


v
Speak the words given below.  Ask children to write the
word and against it two new words that rhyme.

v
Children’s world — their spontaneity  and imagination,
ability to see contradictions in normal behaviour and
moving acts of charity.
v
While covering sections and sub-sections of the text, focus
on situations in which children see themselves.
v
Elicit their comments on, and reactions to, Ravi’s
exaggerations about the kitten’s ancestry, children
cleverly feeding the kitten and Mridu and Meena’s final
act of charity. Focus on values such as sincerity, care
and compassion as exemplified in the episodes.
v
Under ‘Working with Language’, highlight some points
about the use of if-clauses.
(i) An if-clause, also known as a conditional clause,
expresses a condition or cause whose result/effect is
felt in the second part of the sentence.
(ii) If the verb in the if-clause is in the present tense,
the other clause normally has ‘will + verb’.
(iii) An if-clause can be placed either at the beginning
or at the end of the main clause.
• I’ll come to your house if it doesn’t rain.
Or
• If it doesn’t rain, I’ll come to your house.
v
Activity 2 under ‘Speaking and Writing’ lends itself to picking
up appropriate language to learn and practise life skills such
as decision-making, negotiating, persuading, etc.  Let all
the children in pairs/groups perform this activity. Help
them, wherever necessary, with appropriate language use.
4/HONEYCOMB


The Rebel
v
Activity 1 is a combination of open-ended as well as
text-based responses. Items (ii) and (iii) entail recalling/
looking at the appropriate lines in the poem whereas (i),
(iv), (v) and (vi) are discussion points.
v
Let children read Introduction to the poem silently and
find the desired word.  The significance of the title will,
then, become amply  clear.
v
The poem contains 15 couplets.  Each couplet may be
recited as an independent unit.
v
Ask children if they think the last couplet expresses the
poet’s own opinion and comment.
v
Relate the last couplet to the discussion item (vi) under
Activity 1.
Gopal and the Hilsa Fish
v
A comic story to be understood through pictures with
strips of text for support.  Children will have a natural
enthusiasm for this new kind of material.
v
Divide the class into small groups.  Let each group look
at and describe a set of pictures (assigned to them) and
construct their own text.  Texts thus produced can be
put together to form a complete story, to be edited for
coherence and accuracy. If necessary, texts may first be
produced in the child’s own language, and the teacher
can help them to reformulate these in English.
Conversely, for children fluent in English, this may
be an opportunity to formulate equivalent texts in
their own languages.
v Picture reading under ‘Speaking and Writing’ to be
attempted in the same manner.
v Word ladder provides an opportunity for vocabulary
building. Elicit the required word from learners by
providing a set of synonyms for it.
cross: angry, annoyed, displeased
tiny: small, little, negligible
NOTES FOR THE TEACHER/5


6/HONEYCOMB
The Shed
v Ask children to look for words/phrases in the poem
suggesting the neglected state of the shed like “spider’s
web hanging”, “rusty” in the first stanza. There are four
more in the second stanza.
v Let children cull out three or four pairs of rhyming words
that come at the end of lines.
v Activity 2 will generate a lot of individual contributions.
Children may even make up spooky stories and quote
them as ‘real’ experiences.  Show interest and belief in
each anecdote.
For the Teacher
Have a discussion in the class on the wordle given
below. Sensitise the learners towards digital mode of
payment.

Before you read
A king has three questions and he is seeking answers to
them. What are the questions? Does the king get what he
wants?

he thought came to a certain king that
he would never fail  if he knew three
things. These three things were: What is the right
time to begin something? Which people should
he listen to? What is the most important thing for
him to do?
The king, therefore, sent messengers
throughout his kingdom, promising a large sum
of money to anyone who would answer these
three questions.
Many wise men came to the king, but they all
answered his questions differently.
In reply to the first question, some said the
king must prepare a timetable, and then follow it
strictly. Only in this way, they said, could he do
everything at its proper time. Others said that it
was impossible to decide in advance the right time
for doing something. The king should notice all
that was going on, avoid foolish pleasures, and
T


8/HONEYCOMB
always do whatever seemed necessary at that
time. Yet others said that the king needed a
council of wise men who would help him act at
the proper time. This was because one man
would find it impossible to decide correctly,
without help from others, the right time for
every action.
But then others said that there were some
things which could be urgent. These things could
not wait for the decision of the council. In order
to decide the right time for doing something, it is
necessary to look into the future. And only
magicians could do that. The king, therefore,
would have to go to magicians.
In their answers to the second question, some
said that the people most necessary to the king
were his councillors; others said, the priests. A
few others chose the doctors. And yet others said
that his soldiers were the most necessary.
To the third question, some said science.
Others chose fighting, and yet others religious
worship.
As the answers to his questions were so different,
the king was not satisfied and gave no reward.
Instead, he decided to seek the advice of a certain
hermit, who was widely known for his wisdom.
The hermit lived in a wood which he never
left. He saw no one but simple people, and so the
king put on ordinary clothes. Before he reached
the hermit’s hut the king left his horse with his
bodyguard, and went on alone.
As the king came near the hermit’s hut, he
saw the hermit digging the ground in front of his
council: a

or to make

hut. He greeted the king and continued digging.
The hermit was old and weak, and as he worked,
he breathed heavily.
The king went up to the hermit and said, “I
have come to you, wise hermit, to ask you to
answer three questions: How can I learn to do
the right thing at the right time? Who are the
people I need most? And what affairs are the
most important?”
The hermit listened to the king, but did not
speak. He went on digging. “You are tired,” said
the king. “Let me take the spade and work in your
place.”
“Thanks,” said the hermit, giving the king his
spade. Then he sat down on the ground.

When the king had dug two beds, he stopped
and repeated his questions. The hermit gave no
answer, but stood up, stretching out his hand for
the spade, and said, “Now you rest, and let me work.”
But the king did not give him the spade and
continued to dig.
One hour passed, then another. The sun went
down behind the trees, and at last the king stuck
the spade into the ground and said, “I came to
you, wise man, for an answer to my questions. If
you can give me no answer, tell me so and I will
return home.”
“Here comes someone running,” said the hermit.
Comprehension Check

II
The king turned round and saw a bearded man
running towards them. His hands were pressed
against his stomach, from which blood was
flowing. When he reached the king he fainted and
fell to the ground. The king and the hermit


THREE QUESTIONS/11
removed the man’s clothing and found a large
wound in his stomach. The king washed and
covered it with his handkerchief, but the blood
would not stop flowing. The king re-dressed the
wound until at last the bleeding stopped.
The man felt better and asked for something
to drink. The king brought fresh water and gave
it to him.  By this time the sun had set and the
air was cool. The king with the hermit’s help
carried the wounded man into the hut and laid
him on the bed. The man closed his eyes and
lay quiet. The king, tired by his walk and the
work he had done, lay down on the floor and
slept through the night. When he awoke, it was
several minutes before he could remember
re-dressed:

where he was or who the strange bearded man
lying on the bed was.
“Forgive me!” said the bearded man in a weak
voice, when he saw that the king was awake.
“I do not know you and have nothing to forgive
you for,” said the king.
“You do not know me, but 1 know you. 1 am
that enemy  of yours who swore revenge on you,
because you put my brother to death and seized
my property. I knew you had gone alone to see that
hermit, and I made up my mind to kill you on your
way home. But the day passed and you did not
return. So I left my hiding-place, and I came upon
your bodyguard, who recognised me and wounded
me. I escaped from him but I should have died if
you had not dressed my wounds. I wished to kill
you, and you have saved my life. Now, if I live, I will
serve you as your most faithful servant and will order
my sons to do the same. Forgive me!”
The king was very happy to have made peace
with his enemy so easily, and to have won him
over as a friend. He not only forgave him but said
he would send his servants and his own doctor
to look after him, and he promised to give back
the man his property.
Leaving the wounded man, the king went out
of the hut and looked round for the hermit. Before
going away he wished once more to get answers
to his questions. The hermit was on his knees
sowing seeds in the beds that had been dug the
day before. The king went up to the hermit and
said, “For the last time I beg you to answer my
questions, wise man.”

THREE QUESTIONS/13
“You have already been answered!” said the
hermit still bending down to the ground and
looking up at the king as he stood before him.
“How have I been answered? What do
you mean?”
“Do you not see?” replied the hermit. “If you
had not pitied my weakness yesterday and had
not dug these beds for me, you would have gone
away. Then that man would have attacked you
and you would have wished you had stayed with
me. So the most important time was when you
were digging the beds. And I was the most
important man, and to do me good was your most
important business. Afterwards, when the man
ran to us, the most important time was when you
were caring for him, because if you had not
dressed his wounds he would have died without
having made peace with you. So he was the most
important man, and what you did for him was
your most important business.
“Remember then, there is only one time that is
important and that time is ‘Now’. It is the most
important time because it is the only time we have
any power to act.
“The most necessary person is the person you
are with at a particular moment, for no one knows
what will happen in the future and whether we
will meet anyone else. The most important
business is to do that person good, because we
were sent into this world for that purpose alone.”

The Squirrel
You may have seen a squirrel sitting on the ground
eating a nut. What did it look like? Here is a poet’s
description of just such a squirrel.
He wore a question mark for tail,
An overcoat of gray,
He sat up straight to eat a nut.
He liked to tease and play,
And if we ran around his tree,
He went the other way.
      MILDRED BOWERS ARMSTRONG
Working with the Poem
1.
Why does the poet say the squirrel “wore a question mark
for tail”? Draw a squirrel, or find a picture of a squirrel
sitting on the ground. How would you describe its tail?
2.
Do we usually say that an animal ‘wears’ a tail? What
do we say? (Think: Does an animal wear a coat? Consult
a dictionary if you like, and find out how ‘wear’ is used
in different ways.)
3.
“He liked to tease and play”. Who is teasing whom?
How ?
