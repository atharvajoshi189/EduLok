Our earth is surrounded by a huge blanket of air
called atmosphere. All living beings on this earth
depend on the atmosphere for their survival. It
provides us the air we breathe and protects us from
the harmful effects of the sun’s rays. Without this
blanket of protection, we would be baked alive by the
heat of the sun during day and get frozen during
night. So it is this mass of air that has made the
temperature on the earth liveable.
COMPOSITION OF THE ATMOSPHERE
Do you know that the air we take in while breathing is
actually a mixture of many gases? Nitrogen and oxygen
are two gases which make up the bulk of the
atmosphere. Carbon
dioxide, 
helium,
ozone, argon and
hydrogen are found
in lesser quantities.
Apart from these
gases, tiny dust
particles are also
present in the air. The
pie chart gives you the
percentage of different
constituents of air (Fig. 4.1).
Nitrogen is the most
plentiful gas in the air. When
we inhale, we take some
amount of nitrogen into our
lungs and exhale it. But
plants need nitrogen for their
survival. They can not take

Carbon dioxide
released in the
atmosphere creates a
green house effect by
trapping the heat
radiated from the
earth. It is therefore
called a greenhouse
gas and without it the
earth would have been
too cold to live in.
However, when its
level in the
atmosphere increases
due to factory smoke
or car fumes, the heat
retained increases the
temperature of the
earth. This is called
global warming. This
rise in temperature
causes the snow in
coldest parts of the
world to melt. As a
result the sea level
rises, causing floods in
the coastal areas.
There may be drastic
changes in the climate

extinction of some
plants and animals in
the long run.

nitrogen directly from the air. Bacteria, that live in the
soil and roots of some plants, take nitrogen from the
air and change its form so that plants can use it.
Oxygen is the second most plentiful gas in the air.
Humans and animals take oxygen from the air as they
breathe. Green plants produce oxygen during
photosynthesis. In this way oxygen content in the air
remains constant. If we cut trees then this balance
gets disturbed.
Carbon dioxide is another important gas. Green
plants use carbon dioxide to make their food and
release oxygen. Humans or animals release carbon
dioxide. The amount of carbon dioxide released by
humans or animals seems to be equal to the amount
used by the plants which make a perfect balance.
However, the balance is upset by burning of fuels, such
as coal and oil. They add billions of tons of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere each year. As a result, the
increased volume of carbon dioxide is affecting the
earth’s weather and climate.

Do you know?
When air is heated, it
expands, becomes
lighter and goes up.
Cold air is denser and
heavy. That is why it
tends to sink down.
When hot air rises,
cold air from

rushes there to fill in
the gap. That is how
air circulation takes
place.

OUR ENVIRONMENT
STRUCTURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
Our atmosphere is divided into five layers starting from
the earth’s surface. These are Troposphere,
Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere and
Exosphere (Fig. 4.2).
Troposphere: This layer is the most important layer of
the atmosphere. Its average height is 13 km. The air
we breathe exists here.
Almost all the weather
phenomena like rainfall,
fog and hailstorm occur in
this layer.
Stratosphere: Above the
troposphere lies the
stratosphere. It extends up
to a height of 50 km. This
layer is almost free from
clouds and associated
weather phenomenon,
making conditions most
ideal for flying aeroplanes.
One important feature of
stratosphere is that it
contains a layer of ozone
gas. We have just learnt
how it protects us from
the harmful effect of the
sun rays.
Mesosphere: This is the
third 
layer 
of 
the
atmosphere. It lies above
the stratosphere. It extends
up to the height of 80 km.
Meteorites burn up in
this layer on entering from
the space.
Thermosphere: 
In
thermosphere temperature
rises very rapidly with
increasing 
height.
Ionosphere is a part of this
layer. It extends between

80-400 km. This layer helps in radio transmission. In
fact, radio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected
back to the earth by this layer.
Exosphere: The upper most layer of the atmosphere
is known as exosphere. This layer has very thin air.
Light gases like helium and hydrogen float into the
space from here.
WEATHER AND CLIMATE
“Is it going to rain today?” “Will it be bright and sunny
today?” How many times have we heard this from
anxious cricket fans speculating the fate of a One Day
match? If we imagine our body to be a radio and the
mind its speaker, weather is something that fiddles
with its control knobs. Weather is this hour-to-hour,
day to day condition of the atmosphere. A hot or humid
weather may make one irritable. A pleasant, breezy
weather may make one cheerful and even plan for an
outing. Weather can change dramatically from day to
day. However, the average weather condition of a place
for a longer period of time represents the climate of a
place. Now do you understand why we have daily
weather forecasts.
Temperature
The temperature you feel everyday
is the temperataure of the
atmosphere. The degree of hotness
and coldness of the air is known
as temperature.
The 
temperature 
of 
the
atmosphere changes not only
between day and night but also
from season to season. Summers
are hotter than winters.
An important factor that
influences the distribution of
temperature is insolation.
Insolation is the incoming solar
energy intercepted by the earth.
The amount of insolation
decreases from the equator
towards the poles. Therefore, the

temperature decreases in the same manner. Now do
you understand why poles are covered with snow? If
the earth’s temperature rises too high, it would become
too warm for some crops to grow. Temperature in cities
is much higher than that of villages. The concrete and
metals in buildings and the asaphalt of roads get
heated up during the day. This heat is released during
the night.
Also, the crowded high rise buildings of the cities
trap the warm air and thus raise the temperature of
the cities.
Air Pressure
You will be surprised to know that air above us presses
us with a great force on our bodies. However, we don’t
even feel it. This is because the air presses us from all
directions and our body exerts a counter pressure.
Air pressure is defined as the pressure exerted by the
weight of air on the earth’s surface. As we go up the
layers of atmosphere, the pressure falls rapidly. The air
pressure is highest at sea level and decreases with height.
Horizontally the distribution of air pressure is influenced
by temperature of air at a given place. In areas where
temperature is high the air gets heated and rises. This
creates a low-pressure area. Low pressure is associated
with cloudy skies and wet weather.
In areas having lower temperature, the air is cold. It
is therefore heavy. Heavy air sinks and creates a high
pressure area. High pressure is associated with clear and
sunny skies.
The air always moves from high pressure areas to low
pressure areas.
Wind
The movement of air from high pressure area to low
pressure areas is called wind. You can see wind at work
as it blows dry leaves down the pavement or uproots
trees during a storm. Sometimes when the wind blows
gently you can even see it blowing away smoke or fine
dust. At times wind can be so strong that it is difficult
to walk against it. You must have experienced it is not
easy to hold an umbrella on a windy day. Think of
some other examples when strong winds have created

CYCLONE – NATURE’S FURY
Odisha, located on the eastern
seacoast of India is prone to
cyclones that originate in the
Bay of Bengal. On 17-18
October 1999, cyclone hit five
districts of the state. Another
supercyclone occurred on the
29 
October 
1999, 
that
devastated large portions of the
state. The damages caused
were mainly due to three
factors: wind velocity, rain and
tidal surge. The winds of upto
260 km. per hour lasted for over 36 hours. These high velocity winds
uprooted trees and damaged the kutcha houses. Roof tops of several
industrial sheds and other houses were also blown away. Power supply
and telecom lines snapped completely. Heavy rain occurred under the
influence of the cyclone for three days continuously. These rains led to
flooding in the major rivers of Odisha. The cyclonic winds caused tidal
waves that swept 20 km. inland and brought massive destruction to the
coastal areas. The 7 to 10 m high tidal wave intruded suddenly and
caused massive damage to the standing paddy crops.

broadly divided into three types.
1. Permanent winds – The trade
winds, westerlies and easterlies
are the permanent winds.
These

constantly
throughout the year in a

2. Seasonal winds – These
winds change their direction
in different seasons. For
example monsoons in India.
3. Local winds – These blow
only during a particular
period of the day or year in a
small area. For example, land
and sea breeze. Do you recall the

OUR ENVIRONMENT
The cyclone originated as a “depression” in the Gulf of Thailand,
near east of Port Blair, on 25 October 1999 and gradually moved in a
northwestward direction. It intensified into a supercyclone and hit the area
between Erasama and Balikuda in Odisha on 29 October at 10.30 a.m.
The supercyclone swept the entire coast of Odisha including the
cities of Bhubaneshwar and Cuttack and 28 coastal towns. About 13
million people were affected. A large number of livestock were killed.
Standing crops of paddy, vegetables and fruits were heavily damaged.
Due to salinisation caused by tidal surge, large tracts of agricultural
land have turned infertile. Large tracts of sal, teak and bamboo
plantations have disappeared. The mangrove forests between Paradeep
and Konark vanished.
Moisture
When water evaporates from land and different
water bodies, it becomes water vapour. Moisture
in the air at any time, is known as humidity.
When the air is full of water vapour we call it a
humid day. As the air gets warmer, its capacity
to hold the water vapour increases and so it
becomes more and more humid. On a humid
day, clothes take longer to dry and sweat from
our body does not evaporate easily, making us
feel very uncomfortable.
When the water vapour rises, it starts cooling.
The water vapour condenses causing formation
of droplets of water. Clouds are just masses of
such water droplets. When these droplets of water
become too heavy to float in air, then they come
down as precipitation.
Jet planes flying in the sky leave a white trail
behind them. The moisture from their engines
condenses. We see trails of this condensed
moisture for some time when there is no air
movement to disturb it.
Precipitation that comes down to the earth
in liquid form is called rain. Most of the ground
water comes from rainwater. Plants help preserve
water. When trees on hill sides are cut, rainwater
flows down the bare mountains and can cause
flooding of low lying areas. On the basis of
mechanism, there are three types of rainfall: the
convectional rainfall, the orographic rainfall and
the cyclonic rainfall (Fig. 4.5).
