n Chapter 2 we saw that regions like the Kaveri delta 
 became the centre of large kingdoms. Did you notice 
that there was no mention of a kingdom with Delhi 
as its capital? That was because Delhi became an 
important city only in the twelfth century.  
of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs, who were 
defeated in the middle of the twelfth century by the 
Chauhans (also referred to as Chahamanas) of Ajmer. 
It was under the Tomaras and Chauhans that Delhi 
became an important commercial centre. Many rich

here, called

The transformation of Delhi 
into a capital that controlled vast

with the foundation of the Delhi 
thirteenth century. Take a look at

Understanding Delhi under the Sultans
Histories are known as 
 (singular)/
 
(plural), in Persian, the language of administration 
under the Delhi Sultans.
The authors of 
 were learned men: 
secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers, 
who both recounted events and advised rulers on 
governance, emphasising the importance of just rule. 
The circle of justice 
Fakhr-i Mudabbir wrote in the thirteenth century:   
 A king cannot survive without soldiers. And soldiers cannot 
live without salaries. Salaries come from the revenue collected 
from peasants. But peasants can pay revenue only when 
they are prosperous and happy. This happens when the king 
promotes justice and honest governance.
Do you think the 
circle of justice 
is an appropriate 
term to describe 
the relationship 
between the king 
and his subjects? 
Birthright
Privileges claimed 
on account of 
birth. For example, 
people believed 
that nobles 
inherited their 
rights to govern, 
because they were 
born in certain 
families.
Gender 
distinctions
Social and 
biological 
differences 
between women 
and men. Usually, 
these differences 
are used to argue 
that men are 
superior to women. 
Keep the following additional details in mind: 
(1) the authors of 
 lived in cities (mainly 
Delhi) and hardly ever in villages. (2) They often wrote 
their histories for Sultans in the hope of rich rewards. 
(3) These authors advised rulers on the need to 
preserve an “ideal” social order based on birthright 
and gender distinctions. Their ideas were not shared 
by everybody.
 In 1236 Sultan Iltutmish’s daughter, Raziyya, 
became Sultan. The chronicler of the age, 
Minhaj-us-Siraj, recognised that she was more able 
comfortable at having a queen as ruler. Nor were the 
nobles happy at her attempts to rule independently. 
She was removed from the throne in 1240.


33
DELHI: 12TH TO 15TH... 
What Minhaj-us-Siraj thought about  
Raziyya: What other important  
female rulers of India did?
Minhaj-us-Siraj thought that the queen’s rule went 
against the ideal social order created by God, in which 
women were supposed to be subordinate to men. He 
therefore asked: “In the register of God’s creation, since 
her account did not fall under the column of men, how 
did she gain from all of her excellent qualities?” 
On her inscriptions and coins Raziyya mentioned 
that she was the daughter of Sultan Iltutmish. 
This was in contrast to the queen Rudramadevi 
(1262–1289), of the Kakatiya dynasty of Warangal, 
part of modern Andhra Pradesh. Rudramadevi 
changed her name on her inscriptions and pretended 
she was a man. Another queen, Didda, ruled in 
Kashmir (980–1003). Her title is interesting: it comes 
from “didi” or “elder sister”, an obviously affectionate 
term given to a loved ruler by her subjects. 
Express Minhaj’s ideas in your own words. Do you 
think Raziyya shared these ideas? Why do you 
think it was so difficult for a woman to be a ruler?

A Closer Look: Administration under 
the Khaljis and Tughluqs
The consolidation of a kingdom as vast as the 
Delhi Sultanate needed reliable governors and 
administrators. Rather than appointing aristocrats 
and landed chieftains as governors, the early Delhi 
Sultans, especially Iltutmish, favoured their special 
slaves purchased for military service, called 
 
in Persian. They were carefully trained to man some

Can you think of any reason why a slave would

The Khaljis and Tughluqs continued to use 
 
and also raised people of humble birth, who were often 
their clients, to high political positions. They were 
appointed as generals and governors. However, this 
also introduced an element of political instability. 
Slaves and clients were loyal to their masters and 
patrons, but not to their heirs. Sultans had their own 
servants. As a result the accession of a new monarch 
The patronage of these humble people by the Delhi 
Sultans also shocked many elites and the authors

Officials of Sultan Muhammad Tughluq 
Sultan Muhammad Tughluq appointed Aziz Khummar, 
a wine distiller, Firuz Hajjam, a barber, Manka 
Tabbakh, a cook, and two gardeners, Ladha and 
Pira, to high administrative posts. Ziyauddin Barani, 
a mid-fourteenth-century chronicler, reported their 
appointments as a sign of the Sultan’s loss of political 
judgement and his incapacity to rule. 
Why do you think Barani criticised the Sultan?

Like the earlier Sultans, the Khalji and Tughluq 
monarchs appointed military commanders as 
governors of territories of varying sizes. These lands 
were called

They also paid their soldiers from these revenues.

harsh conditions of service were rigorously imposed 
during the reigns of Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad 
Tughluq. Accountants were appointed by the state to 
check the amount of revenue collected by the

Care was taken that the

prescribed by the state and that he kept the required 
number of soldiers. 
As the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of 
the cities under their control, they forced the landed 
chieftains – the 
aristocrats – and rich landlords 
to accept their authority. Under Alauddin Khalji the 
state brought the assessment and collection of land 
revenue under its own control. The rights of the local 
chieftains to levy taxes were cancelled and they were 
also forced to pay taxes. The Sultan’s administrators 
measured the land and kept careful accounts. Some of 
the old chieftains and landlords served the Sultanate 
as revenue collectors and assessors. There were 
three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called 
 
and amounting to about 50 per cent of the peasant’s 
produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses.
It is important to remember that large parts of 
the subcontinent remained outside the control of 
provinces like Bengal from Delhi and soon after 
annexing southern India, the entire region became 
independent. Even in the Gangetic plain, there

these regions. Sometimes rulers like Alauddin Khalji 
and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control in 
these areas but only for a short duration.

Transoxiana in north-east Iran in 1219 and the Delhi 
Sultanate faced their onslaught soon after. Mongol 
attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the 
reign of Alauddin Khalji and in the early years of 
Muhammad Tughluq’s rule. This forced the two rulers 
to mobilise a large standing army in Delhi which posed 
a huge administrative challenge.
