‘How steady is your hand?’
suggested in Chapter 9 of
Class VI. If not, you may try it out now.
Paheli and Boojho had also set up the
game by connecting an electric circuit
as suggested in Class VI. They had lots
of fun trying it out with their families
and friends. They enjoyed it so much
that they decided to suggest it to a
cousin of theirs who stayed in a
different town. So, Paheli made a neat
drawing showing how the various
electric components were to be
connected (Fig.10.1).

conveniently? It made Boojho wonder if
there was an easier way to represent
these electric components.
10.1 SYMBOLS OF ELECTRIC
COMPONENTS
Some common electric components can
be represented by symbols. In Table 10.1,
some electric components and their
symbols are shown. You may come
across different symbols for these
components in different books. However,
in this book, we shall be using the
symbols shown here.
Look at the symbols carefully. In the
symbol for the electric cell, notice that
there is a longer line and a shorter but
thicker parallel line. Do you recall that
an electric cell has a positive terminal
and a negative terminal? In the symbol
of the electric cell, the longer line
represents the positive terminal and the
thicker, shorter line represents the
negative terminal.
For a switch the ‘ON’ position and
the ‘OFF’ position are represented by the
symbols as shown. The wires used to
connect the various components in a
circuit are represented by lines.
In Table 10.1, a battery and its
symbol are also shown. Do you know
what a battery is? Look at the symbol of
a battery. Can you make out what a
battery could be? For some of the
activities we may need more than one
cell. So, we connect two or more cells
together as shown in Fig.10.2. Notice

Many devices such as torches,
transistors, toys, TV remote controls, use
batteries. However, in some of these
devices the electric cells are not always
placed one after the other as shown in
Fig. 10.2. Sometimes the cells are placed
side by side. Then how are the terminals
of the cells connected? Look carefully
inside the battery compartment of any
device. There is usually a thick wire or
a metal strip connecting the positive
terminal of one cell to the negative
terminal of the next cell (Fig.10.3). In
order to help you to place the cells
correctly in the battery compartment,
‘+’ and ‘–’ symbols are usually printed
there.
How can we connect the cells to
prepare batteries for our activities? You
may make a cell holder, as shown in
Fig.10.4, using a wooden block, two iron
strips and rubber bands. It is necessary

strips tightly.
You could also buy cell holders from
the market for making batteries of two
or more electric cells. Place the cells in
them properly, such that the positive
terminal of one cell is connected to the
negative terminal of the next cell.
Connect a piece of wire each to the two
metal clips on the cell holder as shown
in Fig.10.5.  Your battery is ready for
use.
The symbol used for representing a
battery is shown in Table.10.1.
Let us now draw a circuit diagram of
an electric circuit using symbols shown
in Table 10.1.
Activity 10.1
Make the electric circuit shown in
Fig. 10.7. You used a similar circuit
in Class VI to make an electric bulb
glow. Do you remember that the bulb
glows only when the switch is in the
‘ON’ position? The bulb glows as soon
as the switch is moved to the ‘ON’
position.
 Copy this electric circuit in your
notebook. Make also a circuit diagram
of this circuit using symbols for the
various electric components.
Is your diagram similar to the one
shown in Fig. 10.8?
It is much easier to draw a circuit
diagram using symbols. Therefore, we
generally represent an electric circuit by
its circuit diagram.
Fig. 10.9 shows another circuit
diagram. Is it identical to the circuit
diagram shown in Fig.10.8? In which
way is it different?
Would the bulb glow in this electric
circuit? Recall that the bulb glows only
when the switch is in the ‘ON’ position
and the electric circuit is closed.

Paheli and Boojho wonder whether
the batteries used in tractors, trucks
and inverters are also made from cells.

you help them to find the answer to
this question?

Notice that the key or switch can
be placed anywhere in the circuit.

When the switch is in the ‘ON’
position, the circuit from the
positive terminal of the battery to
the negative terminal is complete.
The circuit is then said to be closed
and the current flows throughout
the circuit instantly.

The amount of heat produced in a
wire depends on its material, length
and thickness. Thus, for different
requirements, the wires of different
materials and different lengths and
thicknesses are used.
The wires used for making electric
circuits do not normally become hot. On
the other hand, the elements of some
electric appliances become so hot that
they are easily visible. The filament of

Incandescent electric bulbs (Fig. 10.12) are often used for lighting but they also
give heat. It means that a part of electricity consumed is used in producing
heat. This is not desirable as it results in the wastage of electricity. The fluorescent
tube-lights and compact fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are better electricity efficient
lighting sources. Nowadays, the use of light emitting diode (LED) bulbs is
increasing. For producing a given intensity of light, LED bulbs consume less
electricity as compared to incandescent bulbs or fluorescent tubes or CFLs.Thus
LED bulbs are much electricity efficient and therefore being preferred.

It is advised to use electrical appliances and gadgets, which are electricity efficient.
Bureau of Indian Standards, New Delhi assigns a Standard Mark on products,

Therefore, damaged fluorescent tubes or CFLs need to be disposed off safely.

One reason for excessive currents in
electrical circuits is the direct
touching of wires. This may happen if
the insulation on the wires has come
off due to wear and tear.  This may
cause a short circuit. Another reason
for excessive current can be the
connection of many devices to a single
socket.  This may cause overload in
the circuit. You might have read
reports in newspapers about fires
caused by short circuits and
overloads.

electrical circuits. There is a maximum
limit on the current which can safely
flow through a circuit. If by accident the
current exceeds this safe limit, the wires
an electric bulb gets heated to such a
high temperature that it starts glowing.
If a large current passes through a
wire, the wire may become so hot that it
may even melt and break. But is it
possible for a wire to melt and break?

battery of four cells. Also, in place of
the nichrome wire, tie a thin strand of
steel wool. (The steel wool is commonly
used for cleaning utensils and is
available in grocery shops.) If there are
any fans in the room, switch them off.
Now pass the current through the circuit
for sometime. Observe the strand of steel
wool carefully. Note what happens.  Does
the strand of steel wool melt and break?
Wires made from some special
materials melt quickly and break when
large electric currents are passed
through them. These wires are used for
making electric fuses (Fig.10.14). In all

Fuses of different kinds are used
for different purposes. Fig. 10.14 shows
fuses used in our houses. Fuses
shown in Fig. 10.15 are generally used

ELECTRIC CURRENT
Activity 10.5
Take the cardboard tray from inside a
discarded matchbox. Wrap an electric
wire a few times around the cardboard
tray. Place a small compass needle
inside it. Now connect the free ends of
this wire to an electric cell through a
switch as shown in Fig.10.17.
Note the direction in which the
compass needle is pointing. Bring a bar
magnet near the compass needle.
Observe what happens. Now, while
watching the compass needle carefully,
move the switch to the ‘ON’ position.
These days Miniature
circuit breakers (MCBs)
are increasingly being
used in place of fuses.
These are switches which
automatically turn off
when current in a circuit

Activity 10.6
Take around 75 cm long piece of
insulated (plastic or cloth covered or
enamelled) flexible wire and an iron nail,
say about 6–10 cm long. Wind the wire
tightly around the nail in the form of a
coil. Connect the free ends of the wire
to the terminals of a cell through a switch
as shown in Fig. 10.19.
Place some pins on or near the end
of the nail. Now switch on the current.
What happens? Do the pins cling to the
tip of the nail? Switch off the current.
Are the pins still clinging to the end of
the nail?
The coil in the above activity behaves
like a magnet when electric current flows
through it. When the electric current is
switched off, the coil generally loses its
magnetism. Such coils are called
electromagnets. The electromagnets
can be made very strong and can lift
very heavy loads. Do you remember the
crane about which you read in Chapter 10
of Class VI? The end of such a crane
has a strong electromagnet attached to
it. The electromagnets are also used to
separate magnetic material from the
junk. Doctors use tiny electromagnets
to take out small pieces of magnetic
material that have accidentally fallen in
Fig. 10.19  An electromagnet
What do you observe? Does the compass
needle deflect? Move the switch back to
the ‘OFF’ position. Does the compass
needle come back to its initial position?
Repeat the experiment a few times.
What does this experiment indicate?
We know that the needle of a compass
is a tiny magnet, which points in
north-south direction. When we bring
a magnet close to it, the needle gets
deflected. We have also seen that
compass needle gets deflected when the
current flows in a nearby wire. Can you
connect the two observations? When the
current flows through a wire, does the
wire behave like a magnet?
This is what a scientist called Hans
Christian Oersted (Fig. 10.18) also
wondered. He was the first person who
noticed the deflection of compass needle
every time the current was passed
through the wire.
So, when electric current passes
through a wire, it behaves like a magnet.
This is the magnetic effect of the electric
current. In fact, an electric current can
be used to make magnets. Do you find
it too surprising?  Let us try it out.
Remember not to switch on the
current for more than a few seconds
at a time. The electromagnet weakens
the cell quickly if left connected.

the electromagnet. There is a contact
screw near the iron strip. When the iron
strip is in contact with the screw, the
current flows through the coil which
becomes an electromagnet. It, then,
pulls the iron strip. In the process, the
hammer at the end of the strip strikes
the gong of the bell to produce a sound.
However, when the electromagnet pulls
the iron strip, it also breaks the circuit.
The current through the coil stops
flowing. Will the coil remain an
electromagnet?
The coil is no longer an electromagnet.
It no longer attracts the iron strip. The
iron strip comes back to its original
position and touches the contact screw
again. This completes the circuit. The
current flows in the coil and the
hammer strikes the gong again.   This
process is repeated in quick succession.
The hammer strikes the gong every time
the circuit is completed.  This is how
the bell rings.
