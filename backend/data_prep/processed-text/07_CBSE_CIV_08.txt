A Shirt in
the Market
This chapter tells us the story
of a shirt ! It begins with the
production of cotton and ends
with the sale of the shirt. We
shall see that a chain of
markets links the producer of
cotton to the buyer of the
shirt in the supermarket.
Buying and selling takes place
at every step in the chain.
Does everyone benefit equally
from this? Or do some people
benefit more than others? We
shall find out.

CHAPTER


87
Did Swapna get a fair price on the
cotton?
Why did the trader pay Swapna
a low price?
Where do you think large farmers
would sell their cotton? How is
their situation different from
Swapna?
A cotton farmer in Kurnool
Swapna, a small farmer in Kurnool (Andhra Pradesh)
grows cotton on her small piece of land. The bolls of
the cotton plant are ripe and some have already
burst, so Swapna is busy picking cotton. The bolls,
which carry the cotton in them, do not burst open
all at once so it takes several days to harvest the
cotton.
Once the cotton is collected, instead of selling it at
Kurnool cotton market, Swapna and her husband
take the harvest to the local trader. At the beginning
of the cropping season, Swapna had borrowed
` 2,500 from the trader at a very high interest rate
to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides for cultivation.
At that time, the local trader made Swapna agree to
another condition. He made her promise to sell all
her cotton to him.
Cultivation of cotton requires high levels of inputs
such as fertilisers and pesticides and the farmers
have to incur heavy expenses on account of these.
Most often, the small farmers need to borrow money
to meet these expenses.
At the trader·s yard, two of his men weigh the
bags of cotton. At a price of ` 1,500 per quintal, the
cotton fetches ` 6,000. The trader deducts
` 3,000 for repayment of loan and interest and pays
Swapna ` 3,000.
Swapna: ` 3,000 only!
Trader: Cotton is selling cheap. There is a lot of
cotton in the market.
Swapna: I have toiled so hard for four months to
grow this cotton. You can see how fine and clean the
cotton is this time. I had hoped to get a much better
price.

A shop in Erode.
Trader: Amma, I am giving you a good price. Other
traders are not even paying this much. You can check
at the Kurnool market, if you do not believe me.
Swapna: Don·t be angry. How can I doubt you? I had
only hoped that we would earn enough from the
cotton crop to last us a few months.
Though Swapna knows that cotton will sell for at
least ` 1,800 per quintal, she doesn·t argue further.
The trader is a powerful man in the village and the
farmers have to depend on him for loans not only for
cultivation, but also to meet other exigencies such
as illnesses, children·s school fees. Also, there are
times in the year when there is no work and no
income for the farmers, so borrowing money is the
only means of survival.
Swapna·s earning from cotton cultivation is barely
more than what she might have earned as a wage
labourer.
The cloth market of Erode
Erode·s bi-weekly cloth market in Tamil Nadu is one
of the largest cloth markets in the world. A large
variety of cloth is sold in this market. Cloth that is
made by weavers in the villages around is also
brought here for sale. Around the market are offices
of cloth merchants who buy this cloth. Other traders
from many south Indian towns also come and
purchase cloth in this market.
 On market days, you would also find weavers
bringing cloth that has been made on order from the
merchant. These merchants supply cloth on order
to garment manufacturers and exporters around the
country. They purchase the yarn and give
instructions to the weavers about the kind of cloth
that is to be made. In the following example, we can
see how this is done.


89
1.This is a merchantĬs shop in the bazaar.
Over the years, these traders have
developed extensive contacts with
garment firms around the country from
whom they get orders. These traders
purchase the yarn (thread) from others.
2. The weavers live in villages around
and take the yarn supplied by these
traders to their homes where the looms
are located in sheds adjacent to their
houses. This photograph shows a
powerloom in one such home.
The weavers and their families spend
long hours working on these looms.
Most weaving units have about  2ĩ8
powerlooms on which the yarn is woven
into cloth. A variety of sarees, towels,
shirting, ladies dress material and
bedsheets are produced in these looms.
3. They then bring back the finished cloth
to the traders. Here, they can be seen
getting ready to go to the merchant in the
town. The trader keeps an account of the
yarn given and pays them money for
weaving this into cloth.

What are the following people
doing at the Erode cloth market²
merchants, weavers, exporters?
In what ways are weavers
dependent on cloth merchants?
Putting-out system² weavers producing
cloth at home
The merchant distributes work among the weavers
based on the orders he has received for cloth. The
weavers get the yarn from the merchant and supply
him the cloth. For the weavers, this arrangement
seemingly has two advantages. The weavers do not
have to spend their money on purchase of yarn. Also,
the problem of selling the finished cloth is taken care
of. Weavers know from the outset what cloth they
should make and how much of it is to be woven.
However, this dependence on the merchants both
for raw materials and markets means that the
merchants have a lot of power. They give orders for
what is to be made and they pay a very low price for
making the cloth. The weavers have no way of
Chapter 8: A Shirt in the Market

Social and Political Life
Weaver·s cooperative
We have seen that the weavers are paid very little by the
merchant under the putting out system. Weaver·s cooperatives
are one way to reduce the dependence on the merchant and to
earn a higher income for the weavers.  In a cooperative, people
with common interests come together and work for their mutual
benefit. In a weaver·s cooperative, the weavers form a group and
take up certain activities collectively. They procure yarn from
the yarn dealer and distribute it among the weavers. The
cooperative also does the marketing. So, the role of the merchant
is reduced, and weavers get a fair price on the cloth.
At times, the government helps the cooperatives by buying cloth from them at a reasonable
price. For instance, the Tamil Nadu government runs a Free School Uniform programme in
the state. The government procures the cloth for this programme from the powerloom weaver·s
cooperatives.  Similarly, the government buys cloth from the handloom weaver·s cooperatives
and sells it through stores known as Co-optex. You might have come across one of these
stores in your town.
If the weavers were to buy yarn on
their own and sell cloth, they
would probably earn three times
more. Do you think this is
possible? How? Discuss.
Do you find similar ¶putting-out·
arrangements in making papads,
masalas, beedis? Find out about
this in your area and discuss in
class.
You might have heard of
cooperatives in your area. It could
be in milk, provisions, paddy, etc.
Find out for whose benefit they
were set up?
knowing who they are making the cloth for or at
what price it will be sold. At the cloth market, the
merchants sell the cloth to the garment factories. In
this way, the market works more in favour of the
merchants.
Weavers invest all their savings or borrow money
at high interest rates to buy looms. Each loom costs
` 20,000, so a small weaver with two looms has to
invest ` 40,000. The work on these looms cannot be
done alone. The weaver and another adult member
of his family work upto 12 hours a day to produce
cloth. For all this work, they earn about
` 3,500 per month.
The arrangement between the merchant and the
weavers is an example of putting-out system,
whereby the merchant supplies the raw material and
receives the finished product. It is prevalent in the
weaving industry in most regions of India.

What are the demands foreign
buyers make on the garment
exporters? Why do the garment
exporters agree to these
demands?
How do the garment exporters
meet the conditions set by the
foreign buyers?
The garment exporting factory near Delhi
The Erode merchant supplies the cotton cloth
produced by the weavers to a garment exporting
factory near Delhi. The garment exporting factory
will use the cloth to make shirts. The shirts will be
exported to foreign buyers. Among the foreign buyers
are businesspersons from the US and Europe who
run a chain of stores. These large stores do business
strictly on their own terms. They demand the lowest
prices from the supplier. In addition, they set high
standards for quality of production and timely
delivery. Any defects or delay in delivery is dealt with
strictly. So, the exporter tries his best to meet the
conditions set by these powerful buyers.
Faced with such pressures from the buyers, the
garment exporting factories, in turn, try to cut costs.
They get the maximum work out of the workers at
the lowest possible wages. This way they can
maximise their own profits and also supply the
garments to foreign buyers at a cheap price.

The Impex garment factory has 70 workers. Most
of them are women. Most of these workers are
employed on a temporary basis. This means that
whenever the employer feels that a worker is not
needed, the worker can be asked to leave. Workers·
wages are fixed according to their skills. The highest
paid among the workers are the tailors who get about
` 3,000 per month. Women are employed as helpers
for thread cutting, buttoning, ironing and packaging.
These jobs have the lowest wages.
The shirt in the United States
A number of shirts are on display at a large clothes
shop in the United States, and are priced at $26.
That is, each shirt sells for $26 or around ` 1,800.
Use the diagram shown in the margin to fill
in the blanks below.
The businessperson purchased the shirts from
the garment exporter in Delhi for ` _______ per shirt.
He then spent ` _______ for advertising in the media,
and another ` _______ per shirt on storage, display
and all other charges. Thus, the cost to this person
is ` 900 while he sells the shirt for ` 1,800.
` __________ is his profit on one shirt! If he is able to
sell a large number of shirts, his profit will be higher.
The garment exporter sold the shirt at ` 300 per

` 25 per shirt. The cost of running his office came to
` 25 per shirt. Can you calculate the profit per shirt
for the garment exporter?
Who are the gainers in the market?
A chain of markets links the producer of cotton to
the buyer at the supermarket. Buying and selling
takes place at every step in the chain. Let us recall
who were the people who were involved in this
process of buying and selling. Did they all gain as
much? There were people who made profits in the
market and there were some who did not gain as
much from this buying and selling. Despite their
having toiled very hard, they earned little. Can you
place them in the table shown here?
Market and equality
The foreign businessperson made huge profits in the
market. Compared to this, the garment exporter
made only moderate profits. On the other hand, the
earnings of the workers at the garment export factory
are barely enough to cover their day-to-day needs.
Similarly, we saw the small cotton farmer and the
weaver at Erode put in long hours of hard work. But
they did not get a fair price in the market for what
they produced. The merchants or traders are
somewhere in between. Compared to the weavers,
they have earned more but it is still much less than
the exporter. Thus, not everyone gains equally in
the market. Democracy is also about getting a fair
wage in the market. Whether it is Kanta or Swapna,
if families don·t earn enough how would they think
of themselves as equal to others?
On one hand, the market offers people
opportunities for work and to be able to sell things
that they grow or produce. It could be the farmer
selling cotton or the weaver producing cloth. On the
other hand, it is usually the rich and the powerful

Did you know that the readymade clothes
that you buy require the work of so many

that get the maximum earnings from the market.
These are the people who have money and own the
factories, the large shops, large land holdings, etc.
The poor have to depend on the rich and the powerful
for various things. They have to depend for loans (as
in the case of Swapna, the small farmer), for raw
materials and marketing of their goods (weavers in
the putting out system), and most often for
employment (workers at the garment factory).
Because of this dependence, the poor are exploited
in the market. There are ways to overcome these such
as forming cooperatives of producers and ensuring
that laws are followed strictly.
