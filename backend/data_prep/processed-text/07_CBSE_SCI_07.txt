Transportation in
Animals and Plants

Y
ou have learnt earlier that all
organisms need food, water and
oxygen for survival. They need to
transport all these to various parts of
their body. Further, animals need to
transport wastes to parts from where
they can be removed. Have you
wondered how all this is achieved? Look
at Fig. 7.1. Do you see the heart and
the blood vessels? They function to
transport substances and together form
the circulatory system. In this chapter,
you shall learn about transport of
substances in animals and plants.
7.1 CIRCULATORY SYSTEM
Blood
What happens when you get a cut on
your body? Blood flows out. But what
is blood? Blood is the fluid which
flows in blood vessels. It transports
substances like digested food from the
small intestine to the other parts of the
body. It carries oxygen from the lungs
to the cells of the body. It also transports
waste for removal from the body.
How does the blood carry various
substances? Blood is composed of a
fluid, called plasma in which different
types of cells are suspended.

One type of cells are the red blood
cells (RBC) which contain a red pigment
called haemoglobin. Haemoglobin
binds with oxygen and transports it to
all the parts of the body and ultimately
to all the cells. It will be difficult to
provide oxygen efficiently to all the cells
of the body without haemoglobin. The
presence of haemoglobin makes blood
appear red.
The blood also has white blood cells
(WBC) which fight against germs that
may enter our body.
Boojho fell down while playing a
game and his knee got injured. Blood
was coming out from the cut. After some
time, he noticed that bleeding had
stopped and a dark red clot had plugged
the cut. Boojho was puzzled about this.
The clot is formed because of the
presence of another type of cells in the
blood, called platelets.
Blood vessels
There are different types of blood vessels
in the body. You know that during
inhalation a fresh supply of oxygen fills
the lungs. Oxygen has to be transported
to the rest of the body.
Also, the blood picks up the waste
materials including carbon dioxide from
the cells. This blood has to go back to
the heart for transport to the lungs for
removal of carbon dioxide as you have
learnt in Chapter 6. So, two types of
blood vessels,  arteries and veins are
present in the body. (Fig. 7.1)
Arteries carry oxygen-rich blood
from the heart to all parts of the body.
Since the blood flow is rapid and at a
high pressure, the arteries have thick
elastic walls.
Let us perform an activity to study
the flow of blood through arteries.
Activity 7.1
Place the middle and index finger of
your right hand on the inner side of your
left wrist (Fig. 7.2). Can you feel some
throbbing movements? Why do you
think there is throbbing? This
throbbing is called the pulse and it is
due to the blood flowing in the arteries.
Count the number of pulse beats in one
minute.
How many pulse beats could you
count? The number of beats per minute
is called the pulse rate. A resting
person, usually has a pulse rate between
72 and 80 beats per minute. Find other
places in your body where you can feel
the pulse.
Record your own pulse beats per
minute and those of your classmates.
Insert the values you obtained in
Table 7.1 and compare them.

Paheli explained that the
pulmonary artery carries blood
from the heart, so it is called an
artery and not a vein. It carries
carbon dioxide-rich blood to the
lungs. Pulmonary vein carries
oxygen-rich blood from the
lungs to the heart. 
Veins are the vessels which carry
carbon dioxide-rich blood from all parts
of the body back to the heart. The veins
have thin walls. There are valves present
in veins which allow blood to flow only
towards the heart.
Refer to Fig. 7.3. Do you see the
arteries divide into smaller vessels? On
reaching the tissues, they divide further
into extremely thin tubes called
capillaries. The capillaries join to form
veins which empty into the heart.
Heart
The heart is an organ which beats
continuously to act as a pump for the
transport of blood, which carries other
substances with it.
Imagine a pump working for
years without stopping! Absolutely
impossible. Yet our heart works like a
pump non-stop. Let us now learn about
the heart.
The heart is located in the chest
cavity with its lower tip slightly tilted
towards the left (Fig. 7.1). Hold your
fingers inwards on your palm. That

Blood Donation
Hundreds of people die due to
unavailability of blood. Voluntary
blood donation is harmless and
painless and can save precious lives.
Blood can be donated at hospitals and
other places authorised by the
government. Donated blood are stored
with special care in Blood Banks.

the size of your fist.
What will happen if the blood rich in
oxygen and the blood rich in carbon
dioxide mix with each other? To avoid
this from happening, the heart has four
chambers. The two upper chambers are
called the atria (singular: atrium) and
the two lower chambers are called the
ventricles (Fig. 7.4). The partition
between the chambers  helps to avoid

where it is pumped to the rest of the
body.
Heartbeat
The walls of the chambers of the heart
are made up of muscles. These muscles
contract and relax rhythmically. This
rhythmic contraction followed by its
relaxation constitute a heartbeat.
Remember that heartbeats continue
every moment of our life. If you place
your hand on the left side of your chest,
you can feel your heartbeat. The doctor
feels your heartbeats with the help of
an instrument called a stethoscope.
A doctor uses the stethoscope as a
device to amplify the sound of the heart.
It consists of a chest piece that carries a
sensitive diaphragm, two ear pieces and
a tube joining the parts. Doctors can
get clues about the condition of your
heart 
by 
listening 
through 
a
stethoscope.
Let us construct a model of a
stethoscope with the materials that are
available around us.

carefully. Do you hear a regular
thumping sound ? The sound is that of
heart beats. How many times did your
heart beat in a minute ? Count again
after running for 4–5 minutes. Compare
your observations.
Record your own pulse rate and heart
beat and that of your friends while
resting and after running and record in
Table 7.2. Do you find any relationship
between your heart beat and pulse rate?
Each heart beat generates one pulse in
the arteries and the pulse rate per
minute indicates the rate of heart beat.
The rhythmic beating of the various
chambers of the heart maintain
circulation of blood and transport of
substances to the different parts of the
body.
Boojho wonders if sponges and
hydra also have blood? Animals such
as sponges and Hydra do not possess
any circulatory system. The water in
which they live brings food and oxygen
as it enters their bodies. The water
carries away waste materials and carbon
dioxide as it moves out. Thus, these
animals do not need a circulatory fluid
like the blood.
Let us now learn about the removal
of waste other than carbon dioxide.
7.2 EXCRETION IN ANIMALS
Recall how carbon dioxide is removed
as waste from the body through the
lungs during exhalation. Also recall that
the undigested food is removed during
egestion. Let us now find out how the
other waste materials are removed from
the body. You may wonder where these
unwanted materials come from!
When our cells perform their
functions, certain waste products are
released. These are toxic and hence need
to be removed from the body. The
process of removal of wastes produced
in the cells of the living organisms is
called excretion. The parts involved in
excretion form the excretory system.
Excretory system in humans
The waste which is present in the blood
has to be removed from the body. How
can this be done? A mechanism to filter
the blood is required. This is done by
the blood capillaries in the kidneys.
When the blood reaches the two kidneys,
it contains both useful and harmful
substances. The useful substances are
absorbed back into the blood. The
wastes dissolved in water are removed
as urine. From the kidneys, the urine
goes into the urinary bladder through
The English physician, William Harvey
(A.D.1578–1657), discovered the
circulation of blood. The current
opinion in those days was that blood
oscillates in the vessels of the body.
For his views, Harvey was ridiculed
and was called “circulator”. He lost
most of his patients. However, before
he died, Harvey’s idea about
circulation was generally accepted as
a biological fact.

Sometimes a person’s kidneys may
stop working due to infection or
injury. As a result of kidney failure,
waste products start accumulating in
the blood. Such persons cannot
survive unless their blood is filtered
periodically through an artificial
kidney. This process is called dialysis.
tube-like ureters. It is stored in the
bladder and is passed out through the
urinary opening at the end of a
muscular tube called urethra (Fig. 7.6).
The kindeys, ureters, bladder and
urethra form the excretory system.
An adult human being normally
passes about 1–1.8 L of urine in 24
hours. The urine consists of 95% water,
2.5% urea and 2.5% other waste
products.
We have all experienced that we sweat
on a hot summer day. The sweat
Paheli wants to know
whether other animals also
urinate?
The way in which waste chemicals
are removed from the body of the
animal depends on the availability
of water. Aquatic animals like fishes,
excrete cell waste as ammonia which
directly dissolves in water. Some
land animals like birds, lizards,
snakes excrete a semi-solid, white
coloured compound (uric acid). The
major excretory product in humans
is urea.

contains water and salts. Boojho has
seen that sometimes in summer, white
patches are formed on our clothes,
especially in areas like underarms.
These marks are left by salts present in
the sweat.
Does sweat serve any other function?
We know that the water kept in an
earthen pot (matka) is cooler. This is
because the water evaporates from the
pores of the pot, which causes cooling.

Similarly, when we sweat, it helps to cool
our body.
7.3 TRANSPORT OF SUBSTANCES IN
PLANTS
In Chapter 1 you learnt that plants take
water and mineral nutrients from the soil
through the roots and transport it to the
leaves. The leaves prepare food for the
plant, using water and carbon dioxide
during photosynthesis. You also learnt in
Chapter 6 that food is the source of energy
and every cell of an organism gets energy
by the breakdown of glucose. The cells
use this energy to carry out vital activities
of life. Therefore food must be made
available to every cell of an organism.
Have you ever wondered how water and
nutrients absorbed by the root are
transported to the leaves? How is the
food prepared by the leaves carried to
the parts which cannot make food?
Transport of water and
minerals
Plants absorb water and minerals by
the roots. The roots have root hair.
The root hair increase the surface area
of the root for the absorption of water
and mineral nutrients dissolved in
water. The root hair is in contact with
the water present between the soil
particles [Fig. 7.7 (a)].
Can you guess how water moves
from the root to the leaves? What kind
of transport system is present in plants?
Boojho thinks that plants
may have pipes to transport
water to the entire plant like
we have in our homes for the
supply of water.

Well, Boojho is right. Plants have
pipe-like vessels to transport water and
nutrients from the soil. The vessels are
made of special cells, forming the
vascular tissue. A tissue is a group of
cells that perform specialised function
in an organism. The vascular tissue for
the transport of water and nutrients in the
plant is called the xylem [Fig. 7.7 (a)].
The xylem forms a continuous
network of channels that connects roots
to the leaves through the stem and
branches and thus transports water to
the entire plant [Fig. 7.7 (b)].
Paheli says her mother puts
ladyfinger and other vegetables in
water if they are somewhat dry.
She wants to know how water
enters into them.
Boojho wants to know why
plants absorb a large quantity
of water from the soil, then give
it off by transpiration!
Fig. 7.8 (a) Stem placed in coloured water
Does any part of the herb appear
red? If yes, how do you think the colour
reached there?
You can cut the stem across and look
for the red colour inside the stem
(Fig. 7.8(b) and 7.8(c)).
From this activity we see that water
moves up the stem. In other words, stem
conducts water. Just like the red ink,
minerals dissolved in water also move
up the stem, along with water. Water
and minerals go to leaves and other
plant parts, through narrow tubes
(xylem) inside the stem (Fig. 7.7(b)).
You know that leaves synthesise
food. The food has to be transported to
all parts of the plant. This is done by
the vascular tissue called the phloem.
Thus, xylem and phloem transport
substances in plants.
Activity 7.3
We would require a glass tumbler, water,
red ink, a tender herb (e.g., Balsam),
and a blade for this activity.
Pour water to fill one-third of the
tumbler. Add a few drops of red ink to
the water. Cut the base of the stem of
the herb and place it in the glass as shown
in Fig. 7.8(a). Observe it the next day.

What you have learnt

In most animals the blood that circulates in the body distributes food
and oxygen to different cells of the body. It also carries waste products
from different parts of the body for excretion.

Circulatory system consists of the heart and blood vessels.

In humans, blood flows through arteries and veins and the heart acts
as a pumping organ.

Blood consists of plasma, RBC, WBC and platelets. Blood is red due to
the presence of a red pigment, haemoglobin.

The human heart beats about 70–80 times per minute in an adult
person. This is called heart rate.

Arteries carry blood from the heart to all parts of the body.

Veins carry blood from all parts of the body back to the heart.

Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion.
Transpiration
In Class VI you learnt that plants
release a lot of water by the process of
transpiration.
 Plants absorb mineral nutrients and
water from the soil. Not all the water
absorbed is utilised by the plant. The water
evaporates through the stomata present
on the surface of the leaves by the process
of transpiration. The evaporation of water
from leaves generates a suction pull (the
same that you produce when you suck
water through a straw) which can
pull water to great heights in the
tall trees. Transpiration also cools
the plant.
