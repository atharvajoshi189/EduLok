Write the formula to find the
magnitude of the gravitational
force between the earth and an
object on the surface of the earth.
9.1.2 IMPORTANCE OF THE UNIVERSAL
LAW OF GRAVITATION
The universal law of gravitation successfully
explained several phenomena which were
believed to be unconnected:
(i)
the force that binds us to the earth;
(ii)
the motion of the moon around the
earth;
(iii)
the motion of planets around the Sun;
and
(iv)
the tides due to the moon and the Sun.

It reaches a certain height and then it
starts falling down.
We have learnt that the earth attracts
objects towards it. This is due to the
gravitational force. Whenever objects fall
towards the earth under this force alone, we
say that the objects are in free fall. Is there any

While a force may cause one or more
of these effects, it is important to
remember that none of these actions can
take place without the action of a force.
Thus, an object cannot move by itself,
it cannot change speed by itself, it
cannot change direction by itself and
its shape cannot change by itself.
8.6 Contact Forces
Muscular Force
Can you push or lift a book lying on a
table without touching it? Can you lift
a bucket of water without holding it?
Generally, to apply a force on an object,
your body has to be in contact with the
object. The contact may also be with the
help of a stick or a piece of rope.  When
we push an object like a school bag or
lift a bucket of water, where does the
force come from? This force is caused
by the action of muscles in our body.
The force resulting due to the action of
muscles is known as the muscular
force.
It is the muscular force that enables
us to perform all activities involving
movement or bending of our body. In

Outcomes of 
Democracy
Overview
As we begin to wind up our tour of democracy, it is time to move 
beyond our discussion of specific themes and ask a general set of 
questions: What does democracy do? Or, what outcomes can we 
reasonably expect of democracy? Also, does democracy fulfil these 
expectations in real life? We begin by thinking about how to assess 
the outcomes of democracy. After some clarity on how to think on 
this subject, we proceed to look at the expected and actual outcomes 
of democracy in various respects: quality of government, economic 
well-being, inequality, social differences and conflict and finally 
freedom and dignity.
