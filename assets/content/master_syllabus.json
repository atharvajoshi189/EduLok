Fabrics are made from **Yarns**, and Yarns are made from thin strands called **Fibres**.\n\n**The Journey:**\nFibre 🧵 ➔ Yarn 🧶 ➔ Fabric 👕\n\n---\n\n## 1. Types of Fibres\n\n### A. Natural Fibres 🌱\nObtained from nature (plants and animals).\n* **From Plants:** Cotton, Jute.\n* **From Animals:** Wool (Sheep, Goat, Yak), Silk (Silkworm cocoon).\n\n### B. Synthetic Fibres 🧪\nMade from chemical substances in factories.\n* **Examples:** Polyester, Nylon, Acrylic.\n\n| Natural Fibres | Synthetic Fibres |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Absorbs water (Good for summer) | Does not absorb water easily |\n| Biodegradable | Non-biodegradable |\n| Example: Cotton shirt | Example: Nylon ropes |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Plant Fibres: Cotton & Jute\n\n### ☁️ Cotton\n* **Where it grows:** Black soil and warm climate.\n* **States:** Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh.\n* **Cotton Bolls:** The fruit of the cotton plant (lemon size). When mature, they burst open.\n\n> **⚙️ Important Process: Ginning**\n> The process of separating cotton fibres from seeds by combing is called **Ginning**.\n\n### 🌾 Jute\n* **Source:** Stem of the jute plant.\n* **Season:** Rainy season.\n* **States:** West Bengal, Bihar, Assam.\n* **Harvesting:** Stems are harvested and soaked in water for a few days. The stems rot and fibres are separated by hand.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Making Yarn from Fibre\n\n### 🌀 Spinning\nThe process of making yarn from fibres is called **Spinning**.\n* **How?** Fibres from a mass of cotton wool are drawn out and twisted. This brings the fibres together to form a strong yarn.\n* **Tools Used:**\n    1.  **Takli** (Hand Spindle)\n    2.  **Charkha** (Popularized by Mahatma Gandhi)\n    3.  **Spinning Machines** (For large scale)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Yarn to Fabric (Weaving vs Knitting)\n\nHow does thread become cloth? Two main ways:\n\n| Process | Description | Sets of Yarn |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Weaving** | Arranging two sets of yarns together to make a fabric. Done on **Looms**. | **2 Sets** (Criss-cross) |\n| **Knitting** | A single yarn is used to make a piece of fabric (e.g., Socks). Can be done by hand or machines. | **1 Single Yarn** |\n\n> **📝 Exam Tip:**\n> If you pull a thread from a torn sock, the whole fabric unravels. That is **Knitting**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. History of Clothing Material 📜\n* **Ancient Times:** People used bark, big leaves of trees, or animal skins/furs to cover themselves.\n* **Settlement Era:** They learned to weave twigs and grass into mats and baskets.\n* **Early India:** Wore fabrics made of cotton that grew near the river Ganga.\n* **Invention of Sewing Needle:** People started **stitching** fabrics to make clothes. (Before this, they just draped fabrics like Sari/Dhoti).\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Key Keywords\n* **Ginning:** Separation of seeds from cotton.\n* **Spinning:** Making yarn from fibre.\n* **Looms:** Devices used for weaving fabrics (Hand-operated or Power-operated)."

Materials are grouped based on their **Similarities** and **Differences**.\n\n**Basis of Classification:**\n1. Appearance (Lustre)\n2. Hardness\n3. Solubility\n4. Float/Sink\n5. Transparency\n\n---\n\n## 1. Appearance (Lustre) ✨\nMaterials can be classified based on whether they shine or look dull.\n\n* **Lustrous:** Materials that have a shine. Usually metals.\n    * *Examples:* Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron (when freshly cut).\n* **Non-Lustrous (Dull):** Materials that do not shine.\n    * *Examples:* Wood, Cardboard, Paper, Chalk.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Hardness 🪨\n* **Hard:** Materials that cannot be compressed or scratched easily.\n    * *Examples:* Iron, Stone, Wood, Bone.\n* **Soft:** Materials that can be compressed or scratched easily.\n    * *Examples:* Cotton, Sponge, Candle wax.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Solubility in Water 💧\n\n### A. Solids in Water\n| Type | Definition | Examples |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Soluble** | Completely disappears or dissolves in water. | Salt, Sugar. |\n| **Insoluble** | Does not dissolve even after stirring. | Sand, Sawdust, Chalk powder. |\n\n### B. Liquids in Water\n* **Miscible:** Liquids that mix well with water (e.g., Vinegar, Lemon juice).\n* **Immiscible:** Liquids that do not mix and form a separate layer (e.g., Oil, Kerosene).\n\n> **📝 Exam Tip:**\n> Oxygen gas dissolves in water, which helps fish breathe. But Nitrogen gas does not dissolve easily.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Float or Sink? ⛵\n* **Float:** Materials lighter than water stay on the surface.\n    * *Examples:* Dry leaf, Wood, Plastic ball, Feather.\n* **Sink:** Materials heavier than water drop to the bottom.\n    * *Examples:* Stone, Key, Iron nail, Coin.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Transparency (Most Important) 👓\nThis is based on how much light can pass through the material.\n\n| Type | Definition | Examples |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Transparent** | We can see clearly through them. Light passes fully. | Glass, Water, Air, Clear plastic. |\n| **Translucent** | We can see but **not clearly**. Light passes partially. | Oiled paper, Butter paper, Frosted glass. |\n| **Opaque** | We **cannot see** through them at all. No light passes. | Wood, Metal, Wall, Cardboard box. |\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Key Keywords\n* **Material:** The matter from which a thing is or can be made.\n* **Lustre:** The shine of a material.\n* **Opaque:** An object through which you cannot see."

            "notes": "# Changes Around Us\n\n**Status:** ✅ Offline Verified\n**Class:** 6 Science\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Chapter Overview\n\nEverything around us is changing. Day turns into night, nails grow, leaves change color. Changes can be broadly classified into two types:\n\n1. **Reversible Changes** (Can be reversed)\n2. **Irreversible Changes** (Cannot be reversed)\n\n---\n\n## 1. Reversible Changes 🔄\nA change where the substance can be brought back to its original form.\n\n* **Mechanism:** Usually, only the shape or state changes. No new substance is formed.\n* **Examples:**\n    * Melting of Ice into Water (Freeze it to get ice back).\n    * Folding a paper to make a boat (Unfold it to get paper back).\n    * Stretching a rubber band.\n    * Blowing air into a balloon.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Irreversible Changes 🚫\nA change where the substance **cannot** be brought back to its original form.\n\n* **Mechanism:** Often a new substance is formed or permanent damage is done.\n* **Examples:**\n    * Cooking food (Cannot get raw vegetables back).\n    * Bursting a balloon (Cannot fix it).\n    * Burning a paper (Turns to ash).\n    * Growth of a plant or baby.\n    * Sourning of milk (Making Curd).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Changes Caused by Heating (Expansion) 🔥\n\nWhen we heat a substance (especially metals), it increases in size. This is called **Expansion**. When cooled, it shrinks back (**Contraction**).\n\n### 🛠️ The Metal Rim Example (Exam Favorite)\n**How is a metal rim fixed on a wooden wheel?**\n1. The metal rim is made slightly **smaller** than the wooden wheel.\n2. The rim is **Heated**.\n3. It **Expands** (becomes larger) and fits onto the wheel.\n4. Cold water is poured. The rim **Contracts** (shrinks) and fits tightly.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Candle Confusion 🕯️\nBurning a candle involves BOTH changes:\n\n| Process | Type | Reason |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Melting Wax** | **Reversible** | Molten wax can freeze back into solid wax. |\n| **Burning Wick** | **Irreversible** | The thread burns, gives light/smoke, and reduces in length. |\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Comparison Table\n\n| Feature | Reversible | Irreversible |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Original State** | Can be obtained back | Cannot be obtained |\n| **Nature** | Temporary change | Permanent change |\n| **Example** | Wet clothes to dry clothes | Baking a cake |\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Key Keywords\n* **Expansion:** Increase in size on heating.\n* **Contraction:** Decrease in size on cooling.\n* **Evaporation:** Changing water into vapour (Reversible)."
