Food Variety\nThere is a lot of variation in the food eaten in different regions of India. To prepare food, we need **Ingredients**.\n\n* **Example:** To make boiled rice, we need just two materials: **Rice** and **Water**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Food Materials and Sources\nWhere do ingredients come from?\n\n### 🌱 Plants\nPlants are the sources of food ingredients like grains, cereals, vegetables, and fruits.\n* *Examples:* Wheat, Paddy (Rice), Mango.\n\n### 🐄 Animals\nAnimals provide us with milk, meat products, and eggs.\n* *Examples:* Cows, Goats and Buffaloes give milk. Hens give eggs.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Plant Parts as Food\nWe eat many leafy vegetables. We eat fruits of some plants. Sometimes roots, sometimes stems and even flowers.\n\n| Plant Part | Example |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| **Root** | Carrot, Radish, Turnip |\n| **Stem** | Potato, Ginger, Sugarcane |\n| **Leaf** | Spinach, Cabbage |\n| **Flower** | Cauliflower, Pumpkin flowers |\n\n> **💡 Did you know?**\n> Bees collect **Nectar** (sweet juice) from flowers, convert it into **Honey**, and store it in their hive.\n\n---\n\n## 4. What Do Animals Eat?\nAnimals are grouped based on their eating habits:\n\n### A. Herbivores 🌿\nAnimals which eat **only plants** or plant products.\n* *Examples:* Cow, Deer, Goat, Buffalo.\n\n### B. Carnivores 🦁\nAnimals which eat **only other animals**.\n* *Examples:* Lion, Tiger, Lizard.\n\n### C. Omnivores 🐻\nAnimals which eat **both plants and animals**.\n* *Examples:* Dog, Cat, Human beings, Crow.\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Key Keywords\n* **Edible:** Some parts of plants that can be eaten (e.g., Seeds of mustard plant give oil).\n* **Sprouts:** When small white structures grow out of seeds (like Moong or Chana) after soaking in water.",

Fabrics are made from **Yarns**, and Yarns are made from thin strands called **Fibres**.\n\n**The Journey:**\nFibre 🧵 ➔ Yarn 🧶 ➔ Fabric 👕\n\n---\n\n## 1. Types of Fibres\n\n### A. Natural Fibres 🌱\nObtained from nature (plants and animals).\n* **From Plants:** Cotton, Jute.\n* **From Animals:** Wool (Sheep, Goat, Yak), Silk (Silkworm cocoon).\n\n### B. Synthetic Fibres 🧪\nMade from chemical substances in factories.\n* **Examples:** Polyester, Nylon, Acrylic.\n\n| Natural Fibres | Synthetic Fibres |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| Absorbs water (Good for summer) | Does not absorb water easily |\n| Biodegradable | Non-biodegradable |\n| Example: Cotton shirt | Example: Nylon ropes |\n\n---\n\n## 2. Plant Fibres: Cotton & Jute\n\n### ☁️ Cotton\n* **Where it grows:** Black soil and warm climate.\n* **States:** Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh.\n* **Cotton Bolls:** The fruit of the cotton plant (lemon size). When mature, they burst open.\n\n> **⚙️ Important Process: Ginning**\n> The process of separating cotton fibres from seeds by combing is called **Ginning**.\n\n### 🌾 Jute\n* **Source:** Stem of the jute plant.\n* **Season:** Rainy season.\n* **States:** West Bengal, Bihar, Assam.\n* **Harvesting:** Stems are harvested and soaked in water for a few days. The stems rot and fibres are separated by hand.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Making Yarn from Fibre\n\n### 🌀 Spinning\nThe process of making yarn from fibres is called **Spinning**.\n* **How?** Fibres from a mass of cotton wool are drawn out and twisted. This brings the fibres together to form a strong yarn.\n* **Tools Used:**\n    1.  **Takli** (Hand Spindle)\n    2.  **Charkha** (Popularized by Mahatma Gandhi)\n    3.  **Spinning Machines** (For large scale)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Yarn to Fabric (Weaving vs Knitting)\n\nHow does thread become cloth? Two main ways:\n\n| Process | Description | Sets of Yarn |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Weaving** | Arranging two sets of yarns together to make a fabric. Done on **Looms**. | **2 Sets** (Criss-cross) |\n| **Knitting** | A single yarn is used to make a piece of fabric (e.g., Socks). Can be done by hand or machines. | **1 Single Yarn** |\n\n> **📝 Exam Tip:**\n> If you pull a thread from a torn sock, the whole fabric unravels. That is **Knitting**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. History of Clothing Material 📜\n* **Ancient Times:** People used bark, big leaves of trees, or animal skins/furs to cover themselves.\n* **Settlement Era:** They learned to weave twigs and grass into mats and baskets.\n* **Early India:** Wore fabrics made of cotton that grew near the river Ganga.\n* **Invention of Sewing Needle:** People started **stitching** fabrics to make clothes. (Before this, they just draped fabrics like Sari/Dhoti).\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Key Keywords\n* **Ginning:** Separation of seeds from cotton.\n* **Spinning:** Making yarn from fibre.\n* **Looms:** Devices used for weaving fabrics (Hand-operated or Power-operated).",

Transparency\n\n---\n\n## 1. Appearance (Lustre) ✨\nMaterials can be classified based on whether they shine or look dull.\n\n* **Lustrous:** Materials that have a shine. Usually metals.\n    * *Examples:* Gold, Silver, Copper, Iron (when freshly cut).\n* **Non-Lustrous (Dull):** Materials that do not shine.\n    * *Examples:* Wood, Cardboard, Paper, Chalk.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Hardness 🪨\n* **Hard:** Materials that cannot be compressed or scratched easily.\n    * *Examples:* Iron, Stone, Wood, Bone.\n* **Soft:** Materials that can be compressed or scratched easily.\n    * *Examples:* Cotton, Sponge, Candle wax.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Solubility in Water 💧\n\n### A. Solids in Water\n| Type | Definition | Examples |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Soluble** | Completely disappears or dissolves in water. | Salt, Sugar. |\n| **Insoluble** | Does not dissolve even after stirring. | Sand, Sawdust, Chalk powder. |\n\n### B. Liquids in Water\n* **Miscible:** Liquids that mix well with water (e.g., Vinegar, Lemon juice).\n* **Immiscible:** Liquids that do not mix and form a separate layer (e.g., Oil, Kerosene).\n\n> **📝 Exam Tip:**\n> Oxygen gas dissolves in water, which helps fish breathe. But Nitrogen gas does not dissolve easily.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Float or Sink? ⛵\n* **Float:** Materials lighter than water stay on the surface.\n    * *Examples:* Dry leaf, Wood, Plastic ball, Feather.\n* **Sink:** Materials heavier than water drop to the bottom.\n    * *Examples:* Stone, Key, Iron nail, Coin.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Transparency (Most Important) 👓\nThis is based on how much light can pass through the material.\n\n| Type | Definition | Examples |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Transparent** | We can see clearly through them. Light passes fully. | Glass, Water, Air, Clear plastic. |\n| **Translucent** | We can see but **not clearly**. Light passes partially. | Oiled paper, Butter paper, Frosted glass. |\n| **Opaque** | We **cannot see** through them at all. No light passes. | Wood, Metal, Wall, Cardboard box. |\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Key Keywords\n* **Material:** The matter from which a thing is or can be made.\n* **Lustre:** The shine of a material.\n* **Opaque:** An object through which you cannot see.",

            "notes": "# Changes Around Us\n\n**Status:** ✅ Offline Verified\n**Class:** 6 Science\n\n---\n\n## 🧠 Chapter Overview\n\nEverything around us is changing. Day turns into night, nails grow, leaves change color. Changes can be broadly classified into two types:\n\n1. **Reversible Changes** (Can be reversed)\n2. **Irreversible Changes** (Cannot be reversed)\n\n---\n\n## 1. Reversible Changes 🔄\nA change where the substance can be brought back to its original form.\n\n* **Mechanism:** Usually, only the shape or state changes. No new substance is formed.\n* **Examples:**\n    * Melting of Ice into Water (Freeze it to get ice back).\n    * Folding a paper to make a boat (Unfold it to get paper back).\n    * Stretching a rubber band.\n    * Blowing air into a balloon.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Irreversible Changes 🚫\nA change where the substance **cannot** be brought back to its original form.\n\n* **Mechanism:** Often a new substance is formed or permanent damage is done.\n* **Examples:**\n    * Cooking food (Cannot get raw vegetables back).\n    * Bursting a balloon (Cannot fix it).\n    * Burning a paper (Turns to ash).\n    * Growth of a plant or baby.\n    * Sourning of milk (Making Curd).\n\n---\n\n## 3. Changes Caused by Heating (Expansion) 🔥\n\nWhen we heat a substance (especially metals), it increases in size. This is called **Expansion**. When cooled, it shrinks back (**Contraction**).\n\n### 🛠️ The Metal Rim Example (Exam Favorite)\n**How is a metal rim fixed on a wooden wheel?**\n1. The metal rim is made slightly **smaller** than the wooden wheel.\n2. The rim is **Heated**.\n3. It **Expands** (becomes larger) and fits onto the wheel.\n4. Cold water is poured. The rim **Contracts** (shrinks) and fits tightly.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Candle Confusion 🕯️\nBurning a candle involves BOTH changes:\n\n| Process | Type | Reason |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Melting Wax** | **Reversible** | Molten wax can freeze back into solid wax. |\n| **Burning Wick** | **Irreversible** | The thread burns, gives light/smoke, and reduces in length. |\n\n---\n\n## 📝 Comparison Table\n\n| Feature | Reversible | Irreversible |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Original State** | Can be obtained back | Cannot be obtained |\n| **Nature** | Temporary change | Permanent change |\n| **Example** | Wet clothes to dry clothes | Baking a cake |\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Key Keywords\n* **Expansion:** Increase in size on heating.\n* **Contraction:** Decrease in size on cooling.\n* **Evaporation:** Changing water into vapour (Reversible).",

You will learn about **herbs, shrubs, trees**, and also explore **roots, stems, leaves, and flowers**.\n\n---\n\n## 🌱 1. Types of Plants\nPlants are mainly grouped into **three categories** based on size, stem nature, and lifespan.\n\n### ✔ A. Herbs\n- Small, green, tender stems.\n- Usually short in height.\n- Examples: **Mint, Coriander, Wheat**\n\n### ✔ B. Shrubs\n- Medium-sized plants.\n- Hard but not very thick stems.\n- Many branches starting from the base.\n- Examples: **Rose, Cotton, Hibiscus**\n\n### ✔ C. Trees\n- Tall and strong plants.\n- Thick, woody stems called **trunks**.\n- Branches appear high above the ground.\n- Examples: **Mango, Neem, Banyan**\n\n---\n\n## 🌿 2. Stem – The Support System\nThe stem supports the entire plant and performs transport functions.\n\n### Functions of the Stem:\n- Carries **water and minerals** from roots to leaves.\n- Transports **food** from leaves to other parts.\n- Holds leaves, flowers, and fruits.\n- Some stems store food (e.g., **potato**).\n\n### 💡 Activity (Understanding water movement)\nPlace a white flower in colored water → the petals change color → shows movement of water through **stems**.\n\n---\n\n## 🌳 3. Root System\nRoots anchor the plant and absorb nutrients.\n\n### Types of Roots:\n\n#### ✔ A. Taproot\n- One main root with smaller branches.\n- Examples: **Carrot, Mustard, Mango**\n\n#### ✔ B. Fibrous Root\n- No main root; several roots of similar size.\n- Examples: **Grass, Wheat, Onion**\n\n### 🌟 Functions of Roots:\n- Absorb **water and minerals**.\n- Hold the plant firmly in soil.\n- Store food (e.g., **carrot, beetroot**).\n\n---\n\n## 🍃 4. Leaves – The Food Factory\nLeaves perform **photosynthesis** to prepare food.\n\n### Parts of a Leaf:\n- **Midrib** – main thick line.\n- **Veins** – network of lines.\n- **Petiole** – part that attaches leaf to stem.\n\n### Functions of Leaves:\n- Prepare food using **sunlight, water, CO₂, and chlorophyll**.\n- Exchange gases through tiny pores called **stomata**.\n- Lose excess water through **transpiration**.\n\n> 🌞 **Photosynthesis:** Plants make food (glucose) using sunlight.\n\n---\n\n## 🌸 5. Flower – The Reproductive Part\nFlowers help plants reproduce.\n\n### Main parts:\n- **Petals** – colored parts attracting insects.\n- **Sepals** – protect the bud.\n- **Stamens** – male part.\n- **Pistil** – female part.\n\nPollination → Fertilization → Fruits & Seeds\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Key Keywords\n- **Herbs** – small soft-stemmed plants\n- **Shrubs** – medium-sized woody plants\n- **Transpiration** – loss of water from leaves\n- **Stomata** – pores on leaf surface\n- **Taproot/Fibrous root** – types of root systems\n- **Photosynthesis** – process of food making\n\n",

Movement vs. Locomotion\n### ✔ Movement\nWhen any body part changes its position.\n- Example: Bending your arm.\n\n### ✔ Locomotion\nWhole body moves from one place to another.\n- Example: Walking, running.\n\n---\n\n## 🦴 2. The Skeletal System\nThe **skeleton** is the framework of bones that gives shape and support to the body.\n\n### Functions of the Skeleton:\n- Gives **shape** to the body\n- Provides **support**\n- Protects internal organs\n  - Skull → brain\n  - Ribcage → heart & lungs\n  - Backbone → spinal cord\n- Helps in **movement** with muscles\n\n### Main Parts of the Skeleton:\n- **Skull**\n- **Ribcage**\n- **Backbone (vertebral column)**\n- **Shoulder bone**\n- **Pelvic bone**\n- **Limbs (arms and legs)**\n\n---\n\n## 🔗 3. Joints – Where Two Bones Meet\nJoints help in movement. Without joints, our body would be stiff.\n\n### Types of Joints:\n\n### ✔ A. Ball and Socket Joint\n- Allows movement in **all directions**.\n- Examples: **Shoulder**, **Hip**.\n\n### ✔ B. Hinge Joint\n- Allows movement in **one direction only** (like a door).\n- Examples: **Knee**, **Elbow**.\n\n### ✔ C. Pivot Joint\n- Allows **rotation**.\n- Example: Joint between **head and neck**.\n\n### ✔ D. Fixed Joint\n- No movement.\n- Examples: **Bones of skull**.\n\n### ✔ E. Gliding Joint\n- Bones slide over each other.\n- Example: **Wrist**, **Ankle**.\n\n---\n\n## 💪 4. Muscles and Movement\nMovement happens when **muscles contract and relax**.\n\n### How It Works:\n- Muscles work in **pairs**.\n- When **one muscle contracts**, the other **relaxes**.\n- This pulls the bone and makes it move.\n\nExample: Bending and straightening the arm\n- **Biceps** contract → arm bends\n- **Triceps** relax\n- Opposite happens when the arm straightens\n\n---\n\n## 🐍 5. Movement in Animals\nDifferent animals move in different ways depending on their body structure.\n\n### ✔ A. Earthworm\n- No bones.\n- Moves by **muscular contraction** of its body segments.\n- Uses tiny bristles called **setae** for grip.\n\n### ✔ B. Snail\n- Has a shell and a soft body.\n- Moves using a muscular foot.\n- Leaves a trail of **mucus**.\n\n### ✔ C. Snake\n- Moves in a **slithering movement**.\n- Uses its many **vertebrae** and muscles.\n- Forms **curves** to push against the ground.\n\n### ✔ D. Cockroach\n- Has **three pairs of legs** and **two pairs of wings**.\n- Can walk, climb, and fly short distances.\n\n### ✔ E. Birds\n- Have **hollow bones**.\n- **Strong muscles** and **wing shape** help in flying.\n\n---\n\n## 🧩 6. How Fish Swim\n- Fish have **streamlined bodies**.\n- Move by sideways movement of their **muscles and tail**.\n- Fins help in balancing.\n\n---\n\n## 🔑 Key Keywords\n- **Skeleton** – framework of bones\n- **Joints** – where bones meet\n- **Ball & Socket Joint** – movement in all directions\n- **Hinge Joint** – one-way movement\n- **Muscle contraction** – cause movement\n- **Locomotion** – movement from one place to another\n- **Setae** – bristles in earthworm\n- **Streamlined** – shape that reduces water resistance\n\n",

It explains taxes, armies, and administration in ancient India.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How Kings Became Powerful\nEarlier, leaders were chosen by the jana (people). Later, some men became kings by performing the Ashvamedha yajna.\n\n### Ashvamedha Yajna:\n- A horse was let loose.\n- If it entered another kingdom, that land accepted the king’s authority.\n- Priests performed rituals.\n- Kings gained power and land.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Growing Use of Iron\nIron tools (plough, sickle, axes) improved farming and wars.\nThis increased production and supported larger kingdoms.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Mahajanapadas\nAround 2500 years ago, 16 large kingdoms emerged.\nThese were called **mahajanapadas**.\nExamples:\n- Magadha\n- Kuru\n- Panchala\n- Kosala\n\n---\n\n## 4. Fortified Cities\nKings built forts around their capitals.\nReasons:\n- Protection from attacks\n- To control people and trade\n- To display power\n\nBuilding forts required huge resources and manpower.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Taxation\nTo maintain armies and forts, kings needed money.\nSo, they collected taxes.\n\n### Types of Taxes:\n1. Crops (1/6th of produce, called bhaga)\n2. Craftsmen paid taxes on their work\n3. Herders paid animals and milk products\n4. Traders paid on goods sold\n5. Forest people paid in form of forest produce\n\n---\n\n## 6. Agriculture in Mahajanapadas\nFarmers used:\n- Wooden ploughs\n- Iron tools\n- Irrigation\n\nLand was cleared using iron axes. More food production supported larger populations.\n\n---\n\n## 7. The Republic: Gana or Sangha\nSome mahajanapadas were not ruled by kings.\nThey were ruled by a group of people.\n\n### Features of Gana/Sangha:\n- Many rulers shared power\n- They met in assemblies to discuss matters\n- Decisions were taken collectively\n\nExample: Vajji (Lichchhavis) in present-day Bihar.\n\nBuddha appreciated the orderly functioning of ganas.\n\n---\n\n## 8. End of Ganas and Sanghas\nLater, these republics were conquered by monarchies and big empires.\nExample: Gupta and Maurya rulers defeated many ganas.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nMahajanapadas, Ashvamedha, taxes, fortified cities, gana, sangha, republic, iron tools\n",

It describes how days, nights, and seasons are formed, and introduces important concepts such as solstices and equinoxes.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Rotation\nRotation is the spinning of the Earth on its axis.\n- The Earth rotates from west to east.\n- One full rotation takes 24 hours.\n\n### Effects of Rotation:\n1. Causes **day and night**.\n2. Creates **time differences** between places.\n\nThe axis is an imaginary line passing through the North and South Poles.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Revolution\nRevolution is the movement of Earth around the Sun.\n- One full revolution takes **365 days and 6 hours**.\n- The extra 6 hours accumulate to form a leap year (every 4 years, February has 29 days).\n\n### Effects of Revolution:\n1. Causes **seasons**.\n2. Changes the **length of days and nights**.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Inclination of the Earth's Axis\nThe Earth's axis is tilted at **23.5 degrees**.\nThis tilt, combined with revolution, causes changes in seasons.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Solstices\n### Summer Solstice (21 June):\n- Northern Hemisphere tilted towards Sun.\n- Longest day and shortest night in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n### Winter Solstice (22 December):\n- Southern Hemisphere tilted towards Sun.\n- Shortest day and longest night in the Northern Hemisphere.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Equinoxes\nEquinox means \"equal nights\".\nDuring equinox, both hemispheres receive equal sunlight.\n\n### Types:\n1. **Spring (Vernal) Equinox – 21 March**\n2. **Autumn Equinox – 23 September**\n\nDay and night are equal all over the world.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Why Seasons Occur\nSeasons occur because of:\n1. Tilt of Earth's axis.\n2. Revolution around the Sun.\n\nWhen a hemisphere tilts towards the Sun → summer.\nWhen it tilts away → winter.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nRotation, revolution, axis, orbit, solstice, equinox, seasons, leap year, day and night\n",

What Are Fractions?\nA fraction represents a part of a whole.\nFormat → a/b\n- **a = numerator**\n- **b = denominator** (b ≠ 0)\n\n### Types of Fractions\n- **Proper Fraction** → numerator < denominator (e.g., 3/5)\n- **Improper Fraction** → numerator > denominator (e.g., 7/4)\n- **Mixed Fraction** → combination of whole + fraction (e.g., 1 2/3)\n- **Like Fractions** → same denominator\n- **Unlike Fractions** → different denominators\n\n---\n\n## 2. Equivalent Fractions\nFractions that represent the same value.\nExample:\n- 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6\n\nTo find equivalent fractions:\n- Multiply or divide numerator and denominator by the same number.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Comparing Fractions\n### Case 1: Like Fractions\nCompare numerators.\n\n### Case 2: Unlike Fractions\nConvert to *like fractions* using LCM of denominators.\n\nExample:\n- 2/3 ? 3/4\nLCM(3,4) = 12 → 2/3 = 8/12, 3/4 = 9/12 → 3/4 is bigger.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Addition and Subtraction of Fractions\n### Like Fractions\nAdd/subtract numerators; denominator stays same.\n\n### Unlike Fractions\nStep 1: Find LCM of denominators.\nStep 2: Convert to like fractions.\nStep 3: Add/subtract.\n\nExample:\n1/4 + 1/6 → LCM = 12 → 3/12 + 2/12 = 5/12\n\n---\n\n## 5. Multiplication of Fractions\nMultiply numerators and denominators:\n- a/b × c/d = ac / bd\n\nExample:\n2/3 × 4/5 = 8/15\n\n### Multiplying a Fraction by a Whole Number\nExample:\n3 × 1/4 = 3/4\n\n---\n\n## 6. Division of Fractions\nDivision → Multiply by reciprocal.\n\nExample:\n1/2 ÷ 3/4 = 1/2 × 4/3 = 4/6 = 2/3\n\n---\n\n## 7. Decimals\nNumbers with a decimal point.\nExample: 3.45, 0.7\n\n### Place Value System\n- Tenths (1 decimal place)\n- Hundredths (2 decimal places)\n- Thousandths (3 decimal places)\n\n---\n\n## 8. Converting Between Fractions and Decimals\n### Fraction → Decimal\nDivide numerator ÷ denominator.\nExample:\n1/4 = 0.25\n\n### Decimal → Fraction\nWrite in fraction form and simplify.\nExample:\n0.6 = 6/10 = 3/5\n\n---\n\n## 9. Operations on Decimals\n### Addition/Subtraction\nAlign decimal points.\n\n### Multiplication\nMultiply normally, then place decimal according to total decimal places.\n\n### Division\nMove decimal to make divisor a whole number.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nFraction, numerator, denominator, equivalent fraction, mixed number, like fractions, LCM, decimal, place value.\n",

Angle Sum Property\nThe sum of all interior angles of a triangle is always:\n**180°**\n\nExample:\nIf ∠A = 50°, ∠B = 60°, then:\n∠C = 180° − (50° + 60°) = 70°\n\n---\n\n## 6. Exterior Angle Property\nExterior angle = sum of two opposite interior angles.\n\nExample:\nIf exterior angle = 120° and one opposite interior angle = 50°:\nOther opposite angle = 120° − 50° = 70°\n\n---\n\n## 7. Properties of Side Lengths\n### Triangle Inequality\nThe **sum of any two sides** of a triangle is **greater than** the third side.\n\nExample:\nIf sides are 4, 5, 9 → NOT a triangle (4+5=9 → not greater)\n\n---\n\n## 8.

What is a Rational Number?\nA rational number is any number that can be written in the form:\n\n**p/q where p and q are integers and q ≠ 0**\n\nExamples:\n- 3/4, -5/7, 8/1, 0/5\n\nIntegers are also rational numbers because:\n- 5 = 5/1\n- -3 = -3/1\n\n---\n\n## 2. Positive and Negative Rational Numbers\n- **Positive rational numbers:** Both numerator and denominator have the same sign.\n  Example: 3/5, -7/-8\n\n- **Negative rational numbers:** Numerator and denominator have opposite signs.\n  Example: -3/5, 7/-9\n\n---\n\n## 3. Equivalent Rational Numbers\nMultiply or divide numerator and denominator by the same non-zero number.\n\nExample:\n3/4 = 6/8 = 9/12\n\n---\n\n## 4. Standard Form\nA rational number is in **standard form** when:\n- Denominator is **positive**\n- Numerator and denominator have **no common factor** except 1\n\nExample:\n- 18/24 → 3/4 (after dividing by 6)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Comparison of Rational Numbers\nTo compare two rational numbers:\n1. Convert them to like denominators\n2. Compare numerators\n\nExample:\n- 2/3 ? 3/5\nLCM = 15 → 10/15 < 9/15 → 2/3 > 3/5\n\n---\n\n## 6. Rational Numbers on the Number Line\nSteps:\n1. Convert to mixed number (if improper)\n2. Divide the number line into equal parts\n3. Mark the point accordingly\n\nExample:\n3/4 is between 0 and 1; divide into 4 parts and mark the 3rd.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Operations on Rational Numbers\n### Addition/Subtraction\nUse LCM of denominators.\n\n### Multiplication\nMultiply numerators and denominators.\n\n### Division\nMultiply by reciprocal.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nRational number, standard form, equivalent rational numbers, positive rational number, negative rational number, reciprocal, number line.\n",

What is Symmetry?\nA figure is said to be symmetrical if it can be folded or divided into two identical halves.\n\nAn identical half is called the **mirror image** of the other half.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Line of Symmetry\nA line that divides a shape into two equal and identical halves.\nAlso called **axis of symmetry**.\n\n### Examples:\n- Square → 4 lines of symmetry\n- Rectangle → 2 lines\n- Circle → Infinite lines\n- Equilateral triangle → 3 lines\n- Isosceles triangle → 1 line\n\n---\n\n## 3. Types of Line Symmetry\n- **Vertical symmetry**\n- **Horizontal symmetry**\n- **Diagonal symmetry**\n\n---\n\n## 4. Rotational Symmetry\nA figure has rotational symmetry if it looks the same after being rotated **less than 360°**.\n\n### Order of rotational symmetry\nNumber of times the figure looks identical in one full rotation.\n\nExamples:\n- Equilateral triangle → Order 3\n- Square → Order 4\n- Circle → Infinite order\n\n---\n\n## 5. Examples of Symmetry in Real Life\n- Leaves\n- Human face\n- Animals (butterflies)\n- Patterns in art\n- Logos\n- Buildings and monuments\n\n---\n\n## 6. Symmetry in Alphabets and Numbers\nSome letters have line symmetry:\n- A, H, I, M, O, T, U, V, W, X, Y\n\nSome letters have rotational symmetry:\n- N, S, Z (180° symmetry)\n\nNumbers like 0, 8 have rotational and line symmetry.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Reflection\nReflection flips a figure over a line of symmetry to produce a mirror image.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nSymmetry, line of symmetry, rotational symmetry, order, mirror image, reflection.\n",

  "notes": "# Chapter 9: A Shirt in the Market\n\n## Chapter Overview\nThis chapter explains how a simple cotton shirt goes through many stages before reaching the customer. It shows how producers, factory workers, wholesalers, retailers, and consumers are linked in a supply chain.\n\n---\n\n## 1. From Cotton Field to Factory\nA shirt's journey begins in cotton fields.\nSteps:\n1. Cotton farmers grow and harvest cotton.\n2. Cotton is sold to ginning mills.\n3. Ginned cotton is sent to spinning mills.\n4. Thread is woven into cloth.\n5. Cloth is dyed and stitched.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Factory Workers\n- Many workers are hired on low wages.\n- Jobs are often temporary.\n- Long working hours.\n- No job security.\n- Contractors supply workers to big factories.\n\nWorkers get very little compared to the profit earned.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Export and Big Companies\nLarge garment companies buy shirts from factories.\n- They set tight deadlines.\n- They pay factories very low prices.\n- Factories reduce costs by paying low wages.\n\nExport companies earn high profits.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Role of Wholesalers and Retailers\nAfter production:\n1. Factories sell to **wholesalers**.\n2. Wholesalers sell to **retailers**.\n3. Retailers sell to **consumers**.\n\nEach step adds profit.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Consumers\nConsumers buy shirts at much higher prices than the cost of production.\nReasons:\n- Advertising\n- Transportation\n- Retail shop rent\n- Profit margins\n\n---\n\n## 6. Market Inequality\nInequality exists in the supply chain:\n- Workers earn the least.\n- Big companies earn the most.\n- Retailers also earn good profit.\n\nPoor workers face:\n- Low wages\n- No benefits\n- Unsafe working conditions\n\n---\n\n## 7. Fair Wages and Workers' Rights\nTo reduce inequality:\n- Workers should receive fair wages.\n- Laws should protect workers.\n- Safe working conditions must be ensured.\n- No child labour or exploitation.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nSupply chain, factory workers, wholesalers, retailers, consumers, wages, inequality.",

Rocks\nRocks are made of minerals.\nThree major types of rocks:\n\n### (a) Igneous Rocks\n- Formed by cooling of molten magma\n- Called primary rocks\n- Two types:\n  - Intrusive igneous (formed inside earth, slow cooling)\n  - Extrusive igneous (formed on surface, fast cooling)\n\nExamples: Basalt, Granite\n\n### (b) Sedimentary Rocks\n- Formed by deposition of sediments\n- Layers formed over time\n- Often contain fossils\n\nExamples: Sandstone, Limestone\n\n### (c) Metamorphic Rocks\n- Formed when igneous or sedimentary rocks change due to heat and pressure\n\nExamples:\n- Clay → Slate\n- Limestone → Marble\n- Coal → Diamond\n\n---\n\n## 3. Minerals\nMinerals are naturally occurring substances with definite chemical composition.\n\nExamples:\n- Iron\n- Gold\n- Silver\n- Mica\n- Diamond\n\nUses:\n- Construction\n- Jewellery\n- Machinery\n- Electronics\n\n---\n\n## 4.

Waves\nWaves are the rise and fall of seawater.\n\nCaused by:\n- Wind\n\nStrong waves can erode coasts.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Tides\nTides are the regular rise and fall of ocean water.\n\nCaused by:\n- Gravitational pull of Sun and Moon\n\nTypes:\n- **High tide** – water rises\n- **Low tide** – water falls\n\nUses of tides:\n- Helps in navigation\n- Helps fishing\n- Produces tidal energy\n\n---\n\n## 5. Ocean Currents\nOcean currents are streams of water flowing in the ocean.\nTypes:\n- Warm currents\n- Cold currents\n\nExamples:\n- Gulf Stream (warm)\n- Labrador Current (cold)\n\nOcean currents influence climate.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Importance of Water\nWater is essential for:\n- Drinking\n- Farming\n- Industry\n- Life on Earth\n\nWe must conserve water.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nWater cycle, evaporation, condensation, precipitation, tides, waves, ocean currents.",

The answers come from an unexpected source—a wise hermit.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The King's Three Questions\nThe king believes that if he finds answers to these three questions, he will succeed in everything:\n1. What is the **right time** to do something?\n2. Who are the **most important people**?\n3. What is the **most important thing to do**?\n\nMany wise men give different answers, but none satisfy the king.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Hermit\nThe king visits a simple hermit who lives in the forest.\n- The hermit is old and weak.\n- He digs the ground when the king arrives.\n- The king helps him dig.\n\nThe hermit does not answer directly.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Wounded Man\nA bearded man comes running, wounded.\n- The king takes care of him.\n- Bandages his wounds.\n- The man later explains that he had planned to kill the king but was injured by the king’s bodyguards.\n- He asks for forgiveness.\nThe king forgives him.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Answers\nAfter caring for the wounded man, the hermit finally gives the answers:\n- **Right time:** Now (the present moment)\n- **Most important person:** The one you are with\n- **Most important thing:** To do good to the person you are with\n\nThese answers show the value of kindness, presence, and compassion.\n\n---\n\n## Key Message\nTrue wisdom lies in helping others, living in the present, and valuing the people around us.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nHermit, wounded man, forgiveness, present moment, wisdom, compassion.",

The Hilsa Fish Season\nDuring hilsa fish season:\n- Everyone talks about the fish—its size, price, and taste.\n- The king becomes annoyed because no one discusses anything else.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The King's Challenge\nThe king challenges Gopal:\n- “Bring me a huge hilsa fish, and make sure **no one talks about it**.”\nGopal accepts the challenge.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Gopal’s Strange Plan\nTo distract people, Gopal dresses in a **very strange way**:\n- Half-shaven beard\n- Ash smeared on his body\n- Torn clothes\nPeople laugh at him and talk about his appearance, NOT the fish.\n\n---\n\n## 4. At the Palace\nThe guards refuse to let him inside because he looks mad.\nBut Gopal keeps singing loudly until the king hears him.\nHe is brought inside the palace.\n\nWhen the king sees Gopal, he asks:\n- “Why are you dressed like this?”\nGopal replies that no one on the way talked about the fish—only about his appearance.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The King’s Reaction\nThe king laughs and admits that:\n- Gopal has passed the challenge.\n- His intelligence and creativity are remarkable.\n\n---\n\n## Key Message\nBeing clever and thinking differently can solve even the strangest problems.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nHilsa fish, Gopal, king, challenge, cleverness, humour.",

Mr. Willy Wonka creates a magical medicine called **Vita-Wonk** that can make people **younger**.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Willy Wonka’s Problem\nWilly Wonka had earlier invented a medicine called **Wonka-Vite**.\n- It made people **20 years younger**.\nBut something went wrong:\n- Some people became too young.\n- One person became **minus 87 years old** and disappeared!\n\nWonka decides he must invent a *reverse* medicine.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Idea of Vita-Wonk\nHe wants a formula that will:\n- Make people **older**, not younger.\n- Reverse the effects of Wonka-Vite.\n\nWonka thinks:\n- \"To make people older, I must use something that has lived **very long**.\"\n\n---\n\n## 3. Collecting Ancient and Rare Ingredients\nWonka gathers things from the **oldest living creatures** in the world:\n- A **200-year-old tortoise**\n- A **51-year-old horse**\n- A **36-year-old cat**\n- A **207-year-old giant rat**\n- A **400-year-old tree sap**\n- A **168-year-old rabbit**\n- A **97-year-old parrot**\n\nAll these ingredients are added to his bubbling pot.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Final Medicine: Vita-Wonk\nAfter boiling and mixing everything, the result is:\n- **Vita-Wonk** — a powerful formula\n- It makes people grow **older** by many years\n\nWonka tests it on **Oompa-Loompas**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. What Happens After Testing?\nAfter taking Vita-Wonk:\n- An Oompa-Loompa becomes **75 years older** instantly.\n- His hair turns white.\n- His body becomes wrinkled.\n\nWonka finally succeeds in creating the opposite of Wonka-Vite.\n\n---\n\n## Key Message\nThe story highlights:\n- Creativity and imagination\n- Risks of experiments\n- Humor in magical inventions\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nVita-Wonk, Wonka-Vite, Willy Wonka, Oompa-Loompa, experiment, magical medicine.",

  "notes": "# Chapter 8: Fire: Friend and Foe\n\n## Chapter Overview\nThis chapter explains what fire is, how early humans discovered it, how it helps us, how it can be dangerous, and how modern fire-fighting systems work.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What is Fire?\nFire is the result of a chemical reaction.\nTo make fire, three things are needed:\n1. **Fuel** (wood, paper, petrol)\n2. **Oxygen** (from air)\n3. **Heat** (to start the reaction)\n\nThis is called the **Fire Triangle**.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Early Humans and Fire\n- People in ancient times discovered fire by rubbing stones.\n- Fire changed human life.\n- It helped them cook food, keep warm, and protect themselves.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Fire as a Friend\nFire is helpful when used safely:\n- Cooking food\n- Generating electricity\n- Running engines\n- Melting metals\n- Heating homes\n\nFire makes modern life possible.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Fire as a Foe\nFire can be dangerous when:\n- It spreads uncontrollably\n- There is too much fuel\n- There is too much wind\n\nAccidents happen due to:\n- Gas leaks\n- Electrical short circuits\n- Careless handling of fire\n\n---\n\n## 5. How to Control Fire\nSince fire needs **fuel**, **oxygen**, and **heat**, controlling fire means removing one of these.\n\n### Methods:\n- Remove fuel (cut off supply)\n- Remove oxygen (cover fire with sand/blanket)\n- Remove heat (pour water)\n\nWater works because it cools the fuel.\nBut water cannot be used on:\n- Oil fires\n- Electrical fires\n\nFor those, **CO₂ extinguishers** are used.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Modern Firefighters\nFirefighters are trained to:\n- Rescue people\n- Use protective gear\n- Use powerful fire extinguishers\n- Drive fire engines with hoses, ladders, and water tanks\n\nFirefighting requires courage and teamwork.\n\n---\n\n## Key Message\nFire is useful only when controlled. Safety, awareness, and proper equipment help prevent accidents.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nFire triangle, fuel, oxygen, heat, extinguisher, firefighters, combustion.",

Instead of fixing it, he ends up completely dismantling it.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Friend’s Confidence\nThe narrator's friend says proudly:\n- He knows everything about bicycles.\n- He can repair any part.\n\nThe narrator believes him and agrees to let him examine the bicycle.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Beginning of Trouble\nWhen the friend touches the bicycle:\n- He shakes the wheel unnecessarily.\n- He tightens the nut too much.\n- The bicycle suddenly becomes unstable.\n\nThe narrator starts worrying.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The ‘Repair’ Turns into Destruction\nThe friend continues confidently:\n- Removes the front wheel\n- Pulls out the chain\n- Dismantles brakes and handles\n\nBut he cannot put them back properly.\nThe narrator helps him, though he does not understand repairing either.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Bicycle is in Pieces\nSoon the bicycle lies on the ground completely taken apart.\nThe friend’s confidence disappears.\n\nHe finally says:\n- “Some people have no right to own bicycles!”\n\nHe blames the bicycle instead of himself.\n\n---\n\n## 5. The Final Outcome\nAfter hours of struggle:\n- They somehow reassemble the bicycle.\n- It still does not work perfectly.\n- The narrator realizes his friend is not an expert at all.\n\n---\n\n## Key Message\n- Overconfidence can lead to disaster.\n- Not everyone who claims to be an expert actually is.\n- Sometimes doing nothing is better than doing something wrong.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nBicycle, repair, humour, overconfidence, dismantling, narrator.",

What Are Microorganisms?\\nMicroorganisms (microbes) are tiny living organisms seen only through a microscope.\\nThey are present in:\\n- Air\\n- Water\\n- Soil\\n- Inside and outside our body\\n- Food\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 2. Types of Microorganisms\\n### (a) Bacteria\\n- Single-celled organisms\\n- Found everywhere\\n- Example: Lactobacillus (curd)\\n\\n### (b) Fungi\\n- Can be unicellular or multicellular\\n- Example: Yeast, bread mould\\n\\n### (c) Protozoa\\n- Animal-like microbes\\n- Example: Amoeba, Plasmodium (causes malaria)\\n\\n### (d) Algae\\n- Plant-like organisms\\n- Example: Spirogyra, Chlamydomonas\\n\\n### (e) Viruses\\n- Non-living outside host, living inside host\\n- Cause diseases like influenza, COVID-19\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 3. Friendly Microorganisms (Useful)\\n### (a) In Food Industry\\n- **Lactobacillus** turns milk into curd.\\n- **Yeast** helps in baking bread and making alcohol.\\n\\n### (b) In Medicine\\n- Microorganisms produce **antibiotics** like penicillin.\\n- They also help in making **vaccines**.\\n\\n### (c) In Agriculture\\n- **Rhizobium** bacteria fix nitrogen in soil.\\n- Increase soil fertility.\\n\\n### (d) In Cleaning the Environment\\n- Decomposers break down dead plants and animals.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 4. Harmful Microorganisms (Foe)\\n### (a) Disease-Causing Microbes (Pathogens)\\nThey cause diseases in:\\n- Humans\\n- Animals\\n- Plants\\n\\nExamples:\\n- Bacteria: Cholera, tuberculosis\\n- Virus: AIDS, dengue, measles\\n- Protozoa: Malaria\\n- Fungi: Ringworm\\n\\n### (b) Food Spoilage\\nMicrobes spoil food by producing toxins.\\nSigns:\\n- Bad smell\\n- Colour change\\n- Taste change\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 5. Food Preservation Methods\\nTo prevent food spoilage:\\n- **Refrigeration** (low temperature slows growth)\\n- **Heating / Pasteurisation** (kills microbes)\\n- **Dehydration** (removes water)\\n- **Salting and pickling** (high salt/sour stops microbes)\\n- **Sugar** (high sugar prevents growth)\\n- **Chemical preservatives** (sodium benzoate, citric acid)\\n- **Airtight packaging**\\n\\n---\\n\\n## 6.

Cartesian Plane\nThe Cartesian plane is formed by two perpendicular lines:\n- Horizontal line → **x-axis**\n- Vertical line → **y-axis**\n\nWhere they meet is called the **origin (0,0)**.\n\n### Quadrants\nThe plane is divided into four quadrants:\n1. (+,+)\n2. (−,+)\n3. (−,−)\n4. (+,−)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Coordinates of a Point\nA point is written as (x, y).\n- x → distance on x-axis (horizontal)\n- y → distance on y-axis (vertical)\n\nExample:\nPoint (3, 2)\n- Move 3 steps right\n- Move 2 steps up\n\n---\n\n## 3. Plotting Points\nSteps:\n1. Start at origin.\n2. Move horizontally (x direction).\n3. Move vertically (y direction).\n4. Mark the point.\n\nExample:\nPlot (−2, 4): left 2, up 4.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Types of Graphs\n### (a) Bar Graph\nRepresents data using bars.\n\n### (b) Histogram\nUsed for grouped data.\nBars have **no gaps**.\n\n### (c) Line Graph\nShows change over time.\nExample: Temperature variation in a week.\n\n### (d) Linear Graph\nGraph of an equation like:\n- y = 2x\n- x + y = 4\nForms a straight line.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Reading a Line Graph\nLine graphs help in:\n- Identifying trends\n- Finding values at given points\n- Comparing data\n\nExample:\nA rising line → increase.\nA falling line → decrease.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Applications of Graphs\n- Weather reports\n- Science experiments\n- Comparing quantities\n- Economics & population studies\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nCartesian plane, coordinates, x-axis, y-axis, line graph, bar graph, histogram.",

Why Do We Study History?\nHistory helps us understand:\n- How people lived in the past\n- How societies, cultures, and political systems changed\n- How events shaped the present world\n\nHistory is not only about kings and battles; it also includes agriculture, trade, inventions, transport, and daily life.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Importance of Dates in History\nDates are used in history to:\n- Link events together\n- Understand how one event leads to another\n- Observe changes over time\n\nEarlier history books focused mainly on:\n- Important rulers\n- Political events\n- Major battles\n\nModern history includes:\n- Social changes\n- Economic activities\n- Lifestyle of common people\n\n---\n\n## 3. How Do We Periodise History?\nPeriodisation = dividing history into time periods.\n\n### Earlier British Periodisation\nBritish historians divided Indian history into:\n- Hindu Period\n- Muslim Period\n- British Period\n\nThis method is considered flawed because:\n- It divides history only by religion\n- It ignores social and economic changes\n\n### Modern Periodisation\n- Ancient History\n- Medieval History\n- Modern History\n\nThis system is more balanced and widely used.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How British Officials Recorded History\nBritish administrators kept detailed records for:\n- Better control over administration\n- Tax collection\n- Maintaining law and order\n\nThey maintained:\n- Surveys\n- Administrative reports\n- Letters and memos\n- Official documents\n\nHowever, these records were **biased** and showed the British as superior and civilised.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Sources of Modern Indian History\n### (a) Official Records\nLetters, memos, reports, and acts written by British officials.\n\n### (b) Personal Writings\nAutobiographies, diaries, and private letters.\n\n### (c) Newspapers\nHelp historians understand public opinion.\n\n### (d) Surveys\nBritish conducted many surveys:\n- Land surveys\n- Botanical surveys\n- Archaeological surveys\n- Geological surveys\n\nThese helped them learn about land, forests, agriculture, and people.\n\n---\n\n## 6. History from the Eyes of Common People\nModern history focuses also on:\n- Farmers\n- Workers\n- Craftspersons\n- Women\n- Tribes\n- Reformers\n\nIt studies:\n- Lifestyles\n- Social change\n- Technology and transport development\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nHistory, periodisation, surveys, sources, colonialism, administration\n",

  "notes": "# Chapter 2: From Trade to Territory\n\n## Chapter Overview\nThis chapter explains how the British East India Company came to India as traders, how they gained political control through battles and treaties, and how they expanded their rule across India.\n\n---\n\n## 1. East India Company Comes to India\n- The East India Company arrived in India in **1600**.\n- Their main aim: **Trade in spices, silk, cotton, and indigo**.\n- They set up trading posts (factories) in **Surat, Madras, Bombay, and Calcutta**.\n\nEuropean companies competed for trade, leading to battles at sea and disputes over markets.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Need for Fortification\nTo protect their trade, the British:\n- Built **forts**\n- Maintained **armies**\n- Demanded **trade privileges** from rulers\n\nThe Mughal Empire began weakening, so the Company started interfering in Mughal politics.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Battle of Plassey (1757)\nA turning point in Indian history.\n\n### Why it happened:\n- Nawab of Bengal (**Siraj-ud-Daulah**) opposed British expansion.\n- British misused trade privileges.\n- British supported Mir Jafar against the Nawab.\n\n### Outcome:\n- British **won** due to betrayal by Mir Jafar.\n- They gained control over **Bengal's revenue**.\n\nThis marked the **beginning of British rule in India**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Battle of Buxar (1764)\nFought between:\n- British vs. Mir Qasim, Shah Alam II, and Nawab of Awadh\n\nOutcome:\n- British victory\n- They got **Diwani rights** (right to collect revenue) of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.\n\nThis gave the Company **financial power**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Expansion under Warren Hastings\nGovernor-General Warren Hastings introduced:\n- **Court reforms**\n- **Revenue reforms**\n- **Administrative systems**\n\nThe Company strengthened control through:\n- Residents in Indian courts\n- Interference in succession disputes\n- Wars and annexations\n\n---\n\n## 6. The Subsidiary Alliance\nIntroduced by **Lord Wellesley**.\n\nMain features:\n- Indian rulers had to accept British troops.\n- They had to **pay** for maintenance of these troops.\n- If they failed, part of their territory was taken away.\n\nHyder Ali and Tipu Sultan opposed this policy strongly.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Conquest of Mysore\n### Important wars:\n1. **First Anglo-Mysore War (1767–69)**\n2. **Second Anglo-Mysore War (1780–84)**\n3. **Third Anglo-Mysore War (1790–92)**\n4. **Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799)** – Tipu Sultan died\n\nOutcome:\n- Mysore came under British control.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Annexation of Maratha Territory\nMarathas lost due to:\n- Internal conflicts\n- Anglo-Maratha Wars (1775–1818)\n\nOutcome:\n- British gained control over **central India**.\n\n---\n\n## 9. The Doctrine of Lapse\nIntroduced by **Lord Dalhousie**.\n\nIf a ruler died **without a male heir**, the kingdom was annexed by the British.\n\nStates annexed:\n- Satara\n- Nagpur\n- Jhansi\n- Udaipur\n\nRani Lakshmibai strongly opposed this.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Administrative Reforms\nBritish improved:\n- Postal services\n- Roads and communication\n- Revenue systems\n\nBut their main aim remained **economic gain and political control**.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nPlassey, Buxar, Diwani Rights, Subsidiary Alliance, Doctrine of Lapse, Nawabs, Tipu Sultan\n",

  "notes": "# Chapter 3: Ruling the Countryside\n\n## Chapter Overview\nThis chapter explains how the British East India Company took control of land revenue collection, introduced new systems of taxation, and forced farmers to grow indigo, which led to widespread exploitation and rebellions.\n\n---\n\n## 1. The Company Becomes Diwan\nIn **1765**, after the Battle of Buxar, the Company received **Diwani rights** — the right to collect revenue from Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa.\n\nThis made the Company responsible for:\n- Revenue collection\n- Administering justice\n- Managing trade and economy\n\nBut the Company focused mainly on **maximizing revenue** rather than improving agriculture.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Revenue Collection Systems Introduced by the British\nThe British introduced three main systems:\n\n### (a) Permanent Settlement (1793)\nIntroduced by: **Lord Cornwallis**\n\nKey features:\n- Zamindars were made landowners.\n- They had to pay a **fixed revenue** every year.\n- If they failed, their land was confiscated.\n\nProblems:\n- Revenue was too high.\n- Zamindars exploited peasants.\n- Farmers shifted to cash crops → food scarcity increased.\n\n### (b) Mahalwari Settlement (1822)\nIntroduced by: **Holt Mackenzie**\n\nKey features:\n- Villages (mahals) were responsible for revenue.\n- Village headmen collected revenue.\n- Revenue was periodically revised.\n\n### (c) Ryotwari System\nIntroduced in: **Madras & Bombay Presidencies**\n\nKey features:\n- Revenue collected directly from **ryots** (farmers).\n- No zamindars involved.\n- High revenue demands caused hardship.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Blue Rebellion and Indigo Cultivation\nIndigo was in great demand in **Europe** for dyeing cloth.\n\n### How the Indigo System Worked\nTwo methods:\n\n#### (a) Nij Cultivation\n- Indigo grown on planters' own lands.\n- Required fertile soil.\n- Needed abundant labor and water.\n- Indian farmers disliked working for planters.\n\n#### (b) Ryoti System\n- Most common method.\n- Peasants had to grow indigo on **25%** of their land.\n- They were forced to sign **contracts**.\n- They received loans at high interest.\n- Indigo exhausted soil fertility.\n\nPeasants were trapped in debt.\n\n---\n\n## 4. The Indigo Rebellion (1859–60)\nPeasants of Bengal revolted against the indigo planters.\n\nReasons for rebellion:\n- Low prices paid by British\n- Forced cultivation\n- Harsh treatment\n- Heavy debts\n\nOutcome:\n- Planters fled villages.\n- British appointed an **Indigo Commission**.\n- Indigo cultivation by force was **declared illegal**.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Impact of British Policies on Indian Agriculture\n- Shift to **cash crops** like indigo, cotton, and opium.\n- Decline in food crop production.\n- Frequent famines.\n- Soil degradation.\n- Farmer poverty increased.\n\nThe British policies benefited only the Company, not the Indian farmers.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nDiwani, Permanent Settlement, Mahalwari, Ryotwari, Indigo Rebellion, planters, cash crops\n",

Who Are Tribals?\nTribals are groups of people who:\n- Live in forests, hills, and rural areas\n- Depend on nature for food and livelihood\n- Follow their own traditions, culture, and social rules\n\nTribes included: **Santhals, Mundas, Gonds, Khonds, Bhils, Baigas** and many others.\n\n---\n\n## 2. How Did Tribal Groups Live?\nDifferent tribes had different occupations:\n\n### (a) Jhum Cultivation (Shifting Agriculture)\n- Practised by many tribes in the northeast.\n- Land is cleared, crops are grown, and the land is left to regenerate.\n\n### (b) Hunting and Gathering\n- Collected forest products (roots, fruits, honey, herbs).\n- Hunted animals for food.\n\n### (c) Herding and Animal Rearing\n- Van Gujjars and Gaddis reared sheep, goats, or cattle.\n\n### (d) Settled Cultivation\n- Some tribes like Mundas and Santhals started settled farming.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Who Were the Dikus?\n**Dikus** = Outsiders who troubled tribals.\n\nThey included:\n- British officials\n- Moneylenders\n- Missionaries\n- Traders\n- Zamindars\n\nDikus exploited tribals through taxes, debts, land grabbing, and forced labor.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How British Policies Affected Tribal Lives\nBritish brought new laws that harmed tribal lifestyles.\n\n### (a) Forest Laws\n- Tribals were banned from hunting.\n- Shifting cultivation was restricted.\n- Forest products were taken over by British.\n\nResult: Tribals lost their **freedom, food sources, and livelihood**.\n\n### (b) Land Policies\n- Tribals had to pay land tax.\n- Their lands were taken if they couldn't pay.\n\n### (c) Moneylenders\n- Tribals took loans for seeds and food.\n- High interest → heavy debt → forced labor.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Tribal Movements and Rebellions\nTribals fought back against exploitation.\n\n### (a) The Birsa Munda Movement\nLeader: **Birsa Munda (1875–1900)**\n\nHe urged his people to:\n- Give up alcoholism\n- Work hard\n- Unite against Dikus\n\nHis movement aimed to create a **'Golden Age'** (Satya Yug):\n- No oppression\n- Land would belong to the tribals\n\nAlthough Birsa died young, he became a **symbol of tribal resistance**.\n\n### (b) Other Tribal Rebellions\n- Santhal Rebellion\n- Munda Revolt\n- Khond Uprising\n\nThese protests showed the unity and courage of tribal communities.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nTribals, Dikus, Jhum cultivation, Forest laws, Birsa Munda, Golden Age, Santhal\n",

  "notes": "# Chapter 7: Weavers, Iron Smelters and Factory Owners\n\n## Chapter Overview\nThis chapter explains how Indian industries such as weaving and iron smelting flourished before British rule, how they suffered under colonial policies, and how new factories were set up by Indian entrepreneurs.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Indian Textiles Before British Rule\nIndia was famous worldwide for:\n- Fine cotton (muslin)\n- Silk fabrics\n- Brocade\n- Calico and chintz\n\nIndian textiles were exported to:\n- Europe\n- Africa\n- Southeast Asia\n\nMerchants and weavers were highly skilled and used handlooms.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Coming of the European Companies\nEuropean traders such as:\n- Portuguese\n- French\n- Dutch\n- British\n\ncame to India for spices and textiles.\n\nThe **East India Company** became the most powerful.\n\n---\n\n## 3. The Decline of Indian Weaving\nThe decline happened due to:\n\n### (a) Import of British Machine-made Cloth\n- Cheap factory-made textiles from Britain flooded Indian markets.\n- Indian handloom cloth could not compete.\n\n### (b) Heavy Taxes and Restrictions\n- British imposed high taxes on Indian textiles.\n- No taxes on British cloth → unfair competition.\n\n### (c) Control Over Weavers\nWeavers were forced to:\n- Sell to the Company only\n- Take loans (dadon)\n- Work at low wages\n\nMany weavers left their profession.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Iron and Steel Production in India\nBefore British rule:\n- Many tribes (like Agaria) smelted iron.\n- India had a famous iron pillar near Qutub Minar.\n\nIron smelting required:\n- Charcoal (wood)\n- Good quality ore\n\n---\n\n## 5. Decline of Iron Smelters\nReasons:\n\n### (a) Forest Laws\n- British restricted access to forests.\n- Iron smelters could not collect wood for charcoal.\n\n### (b) Imported Iron\n- Cheap British iron and steel replaced Indian products.\n\n### (c) High Taxes\n- Smelters had to pay high revenue for using furnaces.\n\nThis caused the collapse of local iron industries.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Rise of Modern Factories\nIndian entrepreneurs started modern industries.\n\n### (a) J.N. Tata and Steel\n- Jamshedji Tata founded **TISCO (Tata Iron and Steel Company)** in 1907.\n- Located in Jamshedpur.\n- Used modern technology and machinery.\n\n### (b) Cotton Mills\nDeveloped in:\n- Bombay\n- Ahmedabad\n- Coimbatore\n\n### (c) Jute Mills\n- Located mainly in Bengal\n- Supplied jute sacks to the British empire\n\n---\n\n## 7. Life of Factory Workers\nWorkers faced:\n- Long working hours\n- Low wages\n- No safety\n\nOver time, workers formed unions and demanded better conditions.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nMuslin, weavers, dadon, smelting, TISCO, charcoal, machine-made cloth\n",

What Is Secularism?\nSecularism means:\n- No state religion\n- Equal respect and protection for all religions\n- Freedom to follow any religion or none\n\nIt ensures that the government does not favor or discriminate against any religion.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Why Is Secularism Important?\nIndia has many religions:\n- Hinduism\n- Islam\n- Christianity\n- Sikhism\n- Buddhism\n- Jainism\n\nTo maintain peace and fairness, the government must treat all religions equally.\n\nSecularism prevents:\n- Religious discrimination\n- Forced conversions\n- Domination of one group over another\n\n---\n\n## 3. Secularism in India\nThe Indian Constitution guarantees:\n- Freedom of religion\n- Equality before the law\n- No discrimination based on religion\n\n### Key Constitutional Provisions:\n- Article 14 → Equality before the law\n- Article 15 → No discrimination based on religion\n- Article 25 → Freedom of religion for all\n\nIndia is a **secular democratic republic**.\n\n---\n\n## 4. How the Government Maintains Secularism\n### (a) No Official Religion\nIndia does not have a national or official religion.\n\n### (b) Government Interference to Ensure Equality\nGovernment sometimes intervenes to stop unfair practices.\n\nExample:\n- Abolition of untouchability\n- Laws against child marriage\n\n### (c) Equal Treatment of All Religions\nPublic spaces like:\n- Schools\n- Courts\n- Police stations\ncannot promote any one religion.\n\n### (d) Religious Holidays\nIndia recognizes festivals of multiple religions:\n- Diwali\n- Eid\n- Christmas\n- Guru Nanak Jayanti\n\n---\n\n## 5. Secularism in Other Countries\n### Example: USA\n- Separation of religion from the state\n- Government cannot promote any religion\n\n### Example: France\n- No religious symbols (e.g., headscarves) allowed in public schools\n\nThese models differ from India, where all religions are given equal respect.\n\n---\n\n## Key Keywords\nSecularism, equality, religion, discrimination, freedom of religion, Constitution\n",

Laws for Marginalised Groups:\nTo ensure equality, the government created:\n- SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act\n- Reservation policies\n- Anti-discrimination laws\n\nThese laws help protect dignity and provide fair opportunities.\n\n8. Government Responsibilities:\nThe government must ensure:\n- Fair wages\n- Safe workplaces\n- No child or bonded labour\n- Clean environment\n- Enforcement of labour and environmental laws\n\n9.

  "notes": "Chapter 3: Glimpses of the Past\n\nChapter Overview:\nThis chapter is presented in a comic-strip style. It highlights important events in Indian history between 1757 and 1857, showing how British power grew in India and how Indians gradually united to fight for freedom.\n\n1. India Before the British:\nBefore British rule, India had:\n- Rich culture and traditions\n- Many powerful rulers (Tipu Sultan, Marathas, Nawabs)\n- Prosperous trade and craftsmanship\n\nBut India was not politically united, which made it easier for the British to take control.\n\n2. British Conquest (1757 Onwards):\nThe British East India Company used tactics such as:\n- Divide and rule\n- Strong military force\n- Taking advantage of rivalries between Indian rulers\n\nThe Battle of Plassey (1757) was a turning point. After this, British influence rapidly increased.\n\n3. The Company’s Rule:\nOnce they gained power, the British:\n- Imposed heavy taxes\n- Forced farmers to grow cash crops like indigo\n- Destroyed traditional industries\n- Exported goods to Britain\n\nIndian craftsmen suffered as machine-made British goods replaced handmade Indian products.\n\n4. Social and Cultural Changes:\nThe British introduced:\n(a) Western education\n(b) English language\n(c) Changes in laws\n(d) Christian missionaries\n\nSome reforms were positive, like:\n- Ban on Sati\n- Widow Remarriage Act\n\nBut many Indians felt their culture and traditions were under attack.\n\n5. The Coming of the Revolt:\nBy the mid-1800s, resentment among Indians grew due to:\n- Harsh laws\n- Unfair taxes\n- Land being taken away\n- Religious interference\n- Poor treatment of Indian soldiers (sepoys)\n\nThe final spark came when the new Enfield rifle cartridges were rumored to be greased with cow and pig fat—deeply offensive to Hindu and Muslim soldiers.\n\n6. The Revolt of 1857:\nAlso called the First War of Independence.\nKey leaders:\n- Mangal Pandey\n- Rani Lakshmibai\n- Tatya Tope\n- Nana Saheb\n- Bahadur Shah Zafar\n\nFeatures of the revolt:\n- Started by sepoys in Meerut\n- Spread to Delhi, Kanpur, Lucknow, Jhansi, and more\n- United Hindus and Muslims against the British\n\nThough the revolt failed, it marked the beginning of national awakening.\n\n7. The Rise of Nationalism:\nAfter 1857, Indians slowly united, leading to the formation of:\n- Indian National Congress (1885)\n- National leaders like Gandhi, Nehru, Patel, Tilak, Bose (later years)\n\nThis chapter ends with the message that freedom was achieved through the growing unity of Indians.\n\nKey Keywords:\nEast India Company, Battle of Plassey, indigo, sepoys, 1857 revolt, nationalism, reforms.",

The story explores themes of memory, guilt, and human nature.\n\n1. Main Characters:\n- Bepin Choudhury: A lonely, introverted man who strongly trusts his memory.\n- Parimal Ghose: A stranger who claims that Bepin went to Ranchi.\n- Chuni Lal: Bepin's old friend who later reveals the truth.\n- Dr. Chanda: A doctor who tries to help Bepin.\n\n2. The Mystery Begins:\nBepin meets Parimal Ghose at a bookshop. Parimal claims that Bepin visited Ranchi in 1958 and injured his leg. Bepin becomes confused because he is sure he never went to Ranchi. This creates doubt in his mind.\n\n3. Bepin's Confusion:\nTo check the truth, Bepin examines his diaries and asks his old friend Chuni Lal. Chuni also confirms that the Ranchi trip happened. This increases Bepin's fear that he is losing his memory.\n\n4. Doctor's Advice:\nDr. Chanda suggests that visiting Ranchi might revive Bepin's memory. Bepin travels to Ranchi but nothing seems familiar. He becomes convinced that something is wrong with him.\n\n5. The Truth:\nBepin receives a letter from Chuni Lal. In the letter, Chuni reveals that the entire Ranchi story was a prank. He did this because Bepin never helped him during his difficult times. This was Chuni's way of taking revenge.\n\n6. Final Ending:\nWhen Dr. Chanda calls Bepin for an update, Bepin feels too embarrassed to tell the truth. The story ends with humor.\n\n7. Themes:\n- Human guilt\n- Unreliable memory\n- Revenge and selfishness\n- Importance of helping others\n\n8. Message of the Story:\nWe should be kind and supportive toward others. A small act of selfishness can hurt relationships and lead to guilt later.\n\nKey Keywords:\nMemory loss, Ranchi trip, prank, guilt, revenge, human behavior.",

Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space. It exists mainly in three states: solid, liquid, and gas.\n\n1. Physical Nature of Matter:\n- Matter is made up of tiny particles.\n- These particles are very small and cannot be seen with the naked eye.\n- They are constantly moving.\n- They have space between them.\n\n2. Characteristics of Particles of Matter:\n- They move continuously (Brownian motion).\n- They have force of attraction between them.\n- They have spaces in between.\n\n3. States of Matter:\n- **Solids**: Definite shape and volume, least kinetic energy, strong intermolecular force.\n- **Liquids**: No fixed shape, fixed volume, medium energy and force.\n- **Gases**: No fixed shape and volume, high kinetic energy, very weak attraction.\n\n4. Effect of Temperature:\n- Heating increases the kinetic energy of particles.\n- Solids change to liquids (melting).\n- Liquids change to gases (vaporization).\n- Gases change to liquids (condensation).\n- Liquids change to solids (freezing).\n\n5. Latent Heat:\n- Heat energy required to change the state of matter without changing temperature.\n- Latent heat of fusion (solid → liquid).\n- Latent heat of vaporization (liquid → gas).\n\n6. Evaporation:\n- Process by which liquids change to vapors at any temperature.\n- Increases with temperature, wind speed, surface area, and decreases in humidity.\n\n7. Cooling Effect of Evaporation:\n- When evaporation occurs, particles absorb energy from surroundings, causing cooling.\n\nKey Keywords:\nMatter, particles, kinetic energy, latent heat, evaporation, melting, condensation, Brownian motion.",

Plant Tissues:\nTwo major types:\nA) **Meristematic Tissue** – Actively dividing cells.\n   - Types:\n     1. Apical meristem → at root and shoot tips (length growth).\n     2. Lateral meristem → increases thickness.\n     3. Intercalary meristem → present at nodes (in grasses).\n\nB) **Permanent Tissue** – Non-dividing, specialized cells.\n   - Types:\n     1. **Simple Permanent Tissue**:\n        a) Parenchyma – living cells, storage.\n        b) Collenchyma – flexible support.\n        c) Sclerenchyma – dead cells, hard support.\n\n     2. **Complex Permanent Tissue**:\n        - Xylem – transports water (has tracheids, vessels, xylem fibers, parenchyma).\n        - Phloem – transports food (sieve tube, companion cell, phloem fibers, parenchyma).\n\n3. Animal Tissues:\nFour major types:\nA) **Epithelial Tissue** – Protective covering.\n   - Squamous, cuboidal, columnar, ciliated, glandular.\n\nB) **Connective Tissue** – Connects and supports.\n   - Bone, cartilage, blood, ligament, tendon, areolar tissue, adipose.\n\nC) **Muscular Tissue** – Movement.\n   - Skeletal (voluntary), smooth (involuntary), cardiac (heart).\n\nD) **Nervous Tissue** – Transmits impulses.\n   - Neurons and nerve fibers.\n\n4.

  "notes": "Chapter 5: Introduction to Euclid’s Geometry\n\nChapter Overview:\nThis chapter introduces the basic ideas of geometry developed by the Greek mathematician Euclid. It includes definitions, axioms, postulates, and the structure of geometric reasoning.\n\n1. Euclid – Father of Geometry:\n- Euclid wrote a book \"Elements\" containing 13 volumes of geometry.\n- He introduced logical and systematic study of shapes.\n\n2. Euclid’s Definitions:\nKey definitions:\n- **Point**: That which has no part (no length, breadth, height).\n- **Line**: Breadthless length.\n- **Straight line**: Line that lies evenly with the points on itself.\n- **Surface**: Has length and breadth only.\n- **Plane surface**: Surface lying evenly with straight lines.\n\n3. Axioms:\nStatements accepted without proof.\nExamples:\n- Things equal to the same thing are equal to one another.\n- If equals are added to equals, wholes are equal.\n- A whole is greater than a part.\n\n4. Postulates:\nBasic assumptions specific to geometry.\nEuclid’s 5 Postulates:\n1. A straight line may be drawn from any point to any point.\n2. A finite straight line can be produced indefinitely.\n3. A circle can be drawn with any center and radius.\n4. All right angles are equal.\n5. If a line intersects two lines such that interior angles sum < 180°, the lines meet on that side.\n\n5. Difference between Axioms & Postulates:\n- Axioms: Universal truths.\n- Postulates: Geometrical truths.\n\n6. Euclid’s Geometry vs Present Geometry:\n- Euclid used physical objects → modern geometry uses points as abstract objects.\n\n7. Importance of Euclid’s Geometry:\n- Basis of logical reasoning.\n- Foundation for advanced geometry.\n\nKey Keywords:\nAxioms, postulates, Euclid, point, line, plane, geometry.",

It explains the relationships between radii, chords, and angles inside a circle.\n\n1. What is a Circle?\n- A circle is a collection of all points equidistant from a fixed point (center).\n- Distance from center to any point is radius.\n\n2. Key Terms:\n- **Radius**: Line from center to circle.\n- **Diameter**: Longest chord, passing through center.\n- **Chord**: Line segment joining two points on a circle.\n- **Arc**: Part of the circumference.\n- **Major arc**: Larger arc.\n- **Minor arc**: Smaller arc.\n- **Sector**: Region between two radii and the arc.\n- **Segment**: Region cut by a chord.\n- **Tangent**: A line touching the circle at exactly one point.\n- **Secant**: Line cutting the circle at two points.\n\n3. Perpendicular Bisector Theorem:\n- The perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord.\n- If a chord is bisected at 90°, the line passes through the center.\n\n4. Equal Chords Theorem:\n- Equal chords are equidistant from the center.\n- Conversely, chords equidistant from the center are equal.\n\n5. Angle Properties:\n- Angle at the center is twice the angle at the circumference standing on the same arc.\n- Angles in the same segment are equal.\n\n6. Cyclic Quadrilateral:\n- A quadrilateral with all vertices on a circle.\n- Opposite angles sum to 180°.\n\n7. Tangent Properties (basic intro):\n- A tangent touches a circle at one point.\n- Radius is perpendicular to the tangent at the point of contact.\n\n8.

Area of a Triangle (Standard Formula):\n- Area = 1/2 × base × height\n- Not useful when height is unknown → Heron's formula helps.\n\n2. Heron’s Formula:\nIf a triangle has sides a, b, c:\n- s = (a + b + c) / 2 (semi-perimeter)\n- Area = √(s(s – a)(s – b)(s – c))\n\n3. Steps to Use Heron’s Formula:\n1. Add all sides → find s.\n2. Substitute in formula.\n3. Calculate the value under root.\n4. Find square root → area.\n\n4. Example:\nTriangle sides: 7 cm, 8 cm, 9 cm\ns = (7 + 8 + 9)/2 = 12\nArea = √(12 × 5 × 4 × 3) = √720 = 12√5 cm²\n\n5.

  "notes": "Chapter 15: Probability\n\nChapter Overview:\nThis chapter introduces the idea of chance or likelihood of events. It explains empirical (experimental) probability using real-life situations such as tossing coins, rolling dice, and drawing cards.\n\n1. What is Probability?\n- Probability measures how likely an event is to occur.\n- Value lies between 0 and 1.\n- 0 → impossible event\n- 1 → certain event\n\n2. Trial and Outcome:\n- **Trial**: Action performed (coin toss, dice roll).\n- **Outcome**: Result of trial.\n- Example: Tossing a coin → outcomes: Head (H), Tail (T).\n\n3. Event:\n- A collection of outcomes.\n- Example: Getting an even number on a die → {2, 4, 6}.\n\n4. Experimental Probability:\nFormula:\nP(E) = Number of times event occurred / Total number of trials\n- Only based on actual experiments.\n\n5. Simple Events Examples:\nA) Tossing a coin:\n- Outcomes = 2 → H, T.\n- Probability of getting Head = 1/2.\n\nB) Rolling a dice:\n- Outcomes = 6.\n- Probability of getting a 4 = 1/6.\n\nC) Drawing a card (from 1 to 10):\n- Probability of drawing even number = 5/10 = 1/2.\n\n6. Impossible & Certain Events:\n- Getting a 7 on a die → impossible (probability 0).\n- Sun rising tomorrow → certain (probability 1).\n\n7. Key Note:\nProbability does NOT predict a single outcome—it only gives the tendency of repeated outcomes.\n\nKey Keywords:\nTrial, event, outcome, probability, experiment, likelihood.",

Agriculture in the USA:\n- Large farms called **prairies**.\n- Big landowners used machines—tractors, reapers, threshers.\n- Small farmers could not compete with big farmers.\n\n2. Mechanisation of Agriculture:\n- Technology increased production.\n- Reduced need for workers.\n- Small farmers fell into debt trying to buy machines.\n\n3. The Dust Bowl (1930s):\n- Overuse of land → soil erosion.\n- Severe drought.\n- Huge dust storms destroyed crops.\n- Many farmers became homeless migrants.\n\n4. Agriculture in Japan:\n- Land scarce → intensive farming.\n- Small farms but highly productive.\n- Use of fertilizers and careful management.\n- Farmers often borrowed money → debt.\n\n5. Agriculture in Germany:\n- Junkers (large landowners) had political power.\n- They supported the military.\n- Forced peasants to work under strict conditions.\n\n6. Peasants’ Struggles:\n- High taxes.\n- Debt and poverty.\n- Loss of land.\n- Migration for work.\n\n7. Colonial Impact on Farming:\n- Colonies forced to grow cash crops.\n- Farmers lost rights and faced famine in many regions.\n\n8.
